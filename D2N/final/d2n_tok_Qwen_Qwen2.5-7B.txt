The patient, Larry, has been experiencing chronic back pain for two years, which has worsened over time. He has tried various treatments, including physical therapy and pain medications, but nothing has provided lasting relief. Larry's primary care doctor referred him to the doctor for further evaluation. The doctor conducted a physical examination and reviewed Larry's MRI results, which showed an L4-L5 herniated disk with nerve impingement. Based on this assessment, the doctor recommended a spinal injection with a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and alleviate Larry's pain. The procedure is relatively quick and common, and Larry can expect to be out of the office within an hour.

The patient, Matthew, has been experiencing back pain for a while, which has worsened recently. He has been bedridden and has difficulty walking, standing, and sitting. The pain radiates down his left leg and is described as an electrical toothache. The doctor examines Matthew and finds a positive response to palpation at the L4 vertebrae and pain with flexion and extension of the back. The MRI shows a disk herniation at the L4-L5 level with nerve root impingement. The doctor recommends an epidural steroid injection to reduce inflammation and refers Matthew to physical therapy. Matthew agrees to the treatment plan and will be seen again in a month.

Summary of assessment and plan
[Answer] The patient is a 55-year-old male who presents with acute low back pain and radiating pain down the left leg.
