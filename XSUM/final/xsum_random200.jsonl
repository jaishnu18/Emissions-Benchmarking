{"document": "However his role as used-car salesman Arthur Daley, in the long-running TV series Minder, is the one for which he will be best remembered.\nHis character became synonymous with dodgy dealing and phrases such as \"nice little earner\" and \"er indoors\" passed  into the national lexicon.\nAs well as his numerous screen appearances, he also starred for 15 years in the BBC radio series A Life of Bliss, later adapted for TV.\nGeorge Edward Cole was born in Tooting, south-west London  on 22 Apr 1925. His 16 year old mother abandoned him when he was just ten days old and he was adopted by the Cole family and  brought up on a London council estate.\nHe left school at 14 intending to work as a butcher's boy but,  following the death of his adoptive father, ran away to Blackpool where he successfully auditioned for a part in a touring musical show.\nIn 1940, he played a Cockney evacuee in Cottage To Let, first on stage and then on film. He had gone to the audition for the stage version purely to accompany a friend but ended up getting the part himself.\n\"I was always in plays at school and in school concerts,\" he said. \"You could say I liked to show off.\"\nTogether with his adoptive mother, he was taken in by the  actor Alistair Sim and his wife, Naomi, and appeared with Sim in a number of plays.\nThe Sims ruthlessly worked on ironing out his cockney vowels, determined that he shouldn't be type-cast.\nCole joined the RAF in 1943, where he trained as a wireless operator. When it was discovered that his eyesight wasn't good he was removed from flying duties and transferred to Coastal Command HQ in Northwood before going to Allied occupied Germany to run the bar in an officers' mess.\nAfter the war he returned to acting and, by his late 20s, was a veteran of more than 30 films, few of them memorable, including a role as the love interest of a newly-emerging starlet called Joan Collins, in the 1951 film Bikini Babe.\nHe did have a small role in Laurence Olivier's epic production of Henry V and was, at the time of his death, the last survivor of the huge cast.\nIn 1953, he took over the role of David Bliss, the somewhat bumbling bachelor in the BBC radio comedy, A Life of Bliss. The series ran for 118 episodes, transferring briefly to television in the early 1960s.\nIt was the 1954 film, The Belles of St Trinian's that brought him to the attention of a  wider audience and, incidentally, allowed him to establish the character of the cockney rogue that he would later portray in Minder.\nAs the spiv, Flash Harry, he was a ready source of nylons for the girls in the school and drink for the teachers. The film featured his mentor, Alistair Sim in the dual roles of the headmistress and her crooked brother.\nHe would go on to reprise the role in Blue Murder at St Trinian's in 1957, Blue Murder at St Trinian's in 1960 and The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery in 1966.\nHe was seldom out of work, proving to be a versatile performer who could turn his hand to serious roles, as in The Inspector Calls and musicals like It's a Wonderful World.\nThere was a minor role in the Taylor/Burton version of Cleopatra in 1963 and he even turned his hand to horror in the 1970s, with The Vampire Lovers, which shocked many with its lesbian love scenes.\nThe following year, in another horror film, Fright, he found himself working alongside a young actor named Dennis Waterman - later to star alongside him in Minder.\nCole was also shortlisted for the part of the butler, Hudson, in the London Weekend period drama, Upstairs, Downstairs, a role that eventually went to Gordon Jackson.\nHe remained much in demand appearing in a variety of roles. These included playing the  potter, Josiah Wedgewood in a BBC drama, The Voyage of Charles Darwin and the unscrupulous MP, Sir Giles Lynchwood, in the BBC adaptation of Tom Sharpe's novel, Blott on the Landscape.\nIn one scene of the latter production his character, a secret fetishist,  was left naked, trussed and bound on a bed by a  good natured, but particularly forgetful call girl, memorably played by Julia McKenzie.\nHe also played the author, George Maple, in the BBC sitcom, Don't Forget to Write\nIn 1979 he was offered the part of Arthur Daley in a comedy-drama called Minder, a role that would come to define his career.\nThe character reflected the entrepreneurial era of Thatcher's Britain. \"In an era of greed, he was fairly greedy, but also so unsuccessful,\" Cole once recalled. \"He had the appeal of the eternal loser.\"\nOriginally written as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman, Cole was not the first choice for the part but Waterman's preference for the actor, Denholm Eliot, was overruled by the producers, much to Waterman's annoyance.\n\"We circled round each other for three or four days,\" Cole later recalled. But the pair soon became close friends and developed a rapport on set that saw them improvising scenes to good effect.\nThe drama ran for eleven series, with Gary Webster replacing Dennis Waterman as Terry in 1991, and delivered huge ratings figures for ITV.\nIt also made Cole an unlikely pop star when  his duet with Dennis Waterman, \"What Are We Gonna Get 'Er Indoors?\", reached the UK Top Thirty in 1983.\nAlthough Cole was approaching 70 when Minder finally ended, he continued to work regularly into the new century with guest appearances in a number of series, including Midsomer Murders, and various film roles.\nHe married the actress Eileen Moore in 1954 and the couple had two children. They divorced in 1962 after she left him for someone else. Cole subsequently married another actress, Penny Morrell\nA genial and warm-hearted man, Cole always had mixed feelings about the wheeler-dealer character that had brought him fame and fortune.\n\"I've earned a few sovs from him over the years, so I shouldn't complain, but he was a rogue; a dreadful character, really. I'd certainly lock up the silver if he was coming to dinner.\"", "summary": "George Cole was a veteran of more than 60 films in a career that spanned eight decades.", "id": "13037771"}

{"document": "Exeter Chiefs boss Rob Baxter also says a \"sacking culture\" comparable to football is creeping into rugby union.\nLeicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill became the third boss sacked in eight months on Monday, while five left in five years before 2016.\n\"It appears that coaches are a lot more vulnerable than they had been,\" said RCA founder and director Richard Moon.\nMoon, a former Harlequins scrum-half and Rugby Football Union committee member who established the forerunner to the Rugby Players' Association, said one of the main reasons for setting up the RCA in 2012 was to prevent a \"football-like\" situation from developing.\nBut, when asked whether rugby union was heading towards a hire-and-fire approach, Baxter told BBC Spotlight: \"The facts state that it is.\"\nThe 45-year-old, who has been in charge of the club since 2009 when they were in the second tier, said job security for directors of rugby and coaches will \"unfortunately be driven by the professional game, the need to stay in the Premiership or be successful in the Premiership\".\nCockerill was the second director of rugby sacked this season after Andy Robinson at Bristol, with Mike Ford leaving Bath as head coach last term - just 12 months after being named Premiership coach of the year and having only recently been linked with the England job.\nMoon said the timing of recent departures was more damning than the increase in sackings themselves.\n\"There have been more - but ever more interestingly it's when they are happening,\" said Moon. \"They are tending, more recently, to happen during a season rather than at the end of a season.\n\"As an association we are keeping an eye on these developments. More and more, if coaches are not given a reasonable and realistic chance to get to where they want to be in a season, short-termism is of real concern.\"\nCockerill was sacked 12 games into the campaign with Leicester fifth in the table, just five points adrift of Bath in fourth spot, and having led Tigers to semi-finals in both the Premiership and European Champions Cup only last season.\nIn his eight years in charge, Leicester never failed to reach the Premiership play-offs - winning three titles and finishing runners-up twice.\nRobinson, the former England and Scotland head coach, was sacked by Bristol 10 games into the Premiership season, after guiding them back to the top flight following a seven-year absence last May.\n\"There is more short-termism because rugby is big business now,\" added Moon.\n\"There is more expectation on rugby coaches, certainly in the Premiership, to deliver - and if they are not delivering in a short time frame it would seem that owners are being more proactive than they have been in the past.\n\"Coaches seem to be judged on short-term goals and results. Are they judged a bit like football managers in their first two or three games? Or do you get to Christmas, Easter or the Premiership play-offs? That time period is getting smaller and smaller.\"\nSale director of rugby Steve Diamond admits his job is under scrutiny at the AJ Bell Stadium - with Sharks on an eight-match losing run - but he denies the turnover of coaches can be compared to football.\n\"Are we under pressure? Definitely, we need to get some results,\" Diamond told BBC Radio Manchester.\n\"But we know what we are doing and there is no-one better to get us out of the hole we are in than me.\"\nWhen asked if he thought recent sackings were reactionary, Diamond said: \"No, not really. Each club is run differently and every club has different pressures.\"\nTigers, English rugby's most successful club with 10 domestic titles, last won silverware in 2013, beating Northampton Saints in the last of nine straight Premiership final appearances.\nLeicester lock Ed Slater said the recent spate of sackings were \"what you guys want to write about\" when questioned by BBC Radio Leicester on the subject.\n\"Cockers had been here for a long time,\" he said. \"We haven't been to a Premiership final for three years now and at a club like Leicester we are aware of expectations and he ultimately paid the price - we know we want to win silverware and are expected to win silverware.\n\"Four years without something is a long spell.\"\nExeter boss Baxter said the growing popularity of Premiership rugby and increased riches in the game is where the pressure comes from.\n\"The demands of crowds and rugby clubs and the money that is starting to come into the game through TV, a lot of these things are very positive - we work very hard to build our supporter base and a product that people want to buy.\n\"Unfortunately, one of the repercussions of that is that people become more demanding. Sometimes, rightly or wrongly, in pursuit of success - or what is deemed to be success - someone pays the price.\n\"The fact the Premiership is so competitive is something people should cherish and not be too afraid of. That is the balance you would like to think most clubs would come to.\n\"You understand that a season will tilt with one or two injuries or one or two results. Having the strength to see that through is hopefully what we will get back to in rugby and we won't see a cascade of sackings.\n\"Some sackings and some changes of management happen for reasons outside of rugby results and those always happen - but when purely based on results people need a little more understanding.\"\nMoon says he spoke to Richard Bevan, chief executive of football's League Managers' Association (LMA), when forming the RCA and believes rugby coaches face some harsher realities than their football counterparts.\n\"Unlike football, there is not enough professional or semi-professional clubs out there to realistically believe that if you lose your job you will walk into another one at the same level immediately. It is very rare,\" said Moon.\n\"It is important that coaches get the right level of support and backing that their day job deserves.\n\"Richard was incredibly helpful when we identified this idea. They are a juggernaut of an organisation that have been going for a long time and they do invaluable work.\n\"We are some way behind that in the rugby world.\"\nChris Jones, BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter\n\"It is not necessarily a case that suddenly rugby union has adopted a different culture compared to before, but perhaps there are changes as a result of the competitiveness of the Premiership - influenced by the greater central revenues from Rugby Football Union and TV money - coupled with the new private investment at some clubs.\n\"There are probably seven or eight clubs who truly feel they should occupy the top four - or be even better off - in the Premiership.\n\"These clubs include Saracens, Wasps, Exeter, Bath, Leicester, Northampton, Harlequins, Gloucester, while Sale are a club that firmly considers themselves to be a top-six side. In saying that, Bristol, Worcester and Newcastle are all highly ambitious as well.\n\"Wasps and Sale have been boosted by fairly recent private investment, while Gloucester are on the verge of a takeover. Bristol have a billionaire owner too. These are people who all want success, while the traditional powerhouses such as Leicester, Northampton and Harlequins also demand results.\n\"No club is content with its status quo - maybe apart from European and Premiership champions Saracens - and with high expectations from fans and in the boardrooms, comes pressure on coaches - and sackings.\"", "summary": "The recent spike in Premiership sackings shows a \"worrying trend\", says the Rugby Coaches Association (RCA).", "id": "38502617"}

If approved, it will go to the House of Lords on Wednesday, where it is expected to face further opposition.\nDavid Cameron has said equal marriage would help build a stronger and fairer society but nearly half of all Tories voted against it in February and many party activists remain deeply opposed to it in principle.\nThe bill's fresh scrutiny by MPs comes amid other divisions within the Conservative Party on Europe and attitudes towards the party's grassroots.\nMPs get a free vote on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill because it is considered an issue of conscience and many Conservative MPs spoke out against the principle of gay marriage.\nFormer defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the plans were \"divisive\" and suggested there were are plenty of people \"in the aggressive homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something even further\".\nA group of Tory MPs, led by former Conservative minister Tim Loughton, attempted to amend the bill, with a plan to extend civil partnerships - which came into force in 2005 - to heterosexual couples.\nMr Loughton rejected claims the move was a \"wrecking\" measure, arguing that the extension of civil partnerships to co-habiting heterosexuals would address a \"glaring inequality\" in the current proposals as well as encouraging family stability.\n\"If this amendment is passed, it will remove some of the anomalies and flaws in this bill and make the bill more palatable.\"\nHe warned about any review on civil partnerships being \"kicked into the long grass\", adding that Parliament \"was in danger of being party to a last minute stitch-up between the frontbenches\".\nMinisters initially agreed that the status of civil partnerships should be reconsidered by 2019, with the scope to do it sooner if approved by Parliament.\nMs Miller told MPs there were \"fundamental policy\" issues that needed to be considered with \"financial implications\", such as pension entitlements for heterosexual civil partners, widows and widowers.\nBut while it would not be \"responsible\" to legislate at the moment, she said she respected the strong views on the matter in Parliament and would back calls for an immediate review.\nIt was initially suggested Labour's equalities team might support Mr Loughton's amendment but it later put forward its own compromise proposal for an immediate consultation.\n\"We are certainly anxious to do all we can to ensure that same-sex marriages arrives as swiftly as possible on the statute book,\" shadow equalities minister Kate Green said.\n\"We would not want to see anything put that ambition in jeopardy.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was his party's position to extend civil partnerships to everybody, irrespective of their sexuality but the current bill could not be derailed.\nWithout holding a formal vote, MPs approved plans to hold an immediate review after the leadership of all three parties backed it.\nWhile failing in their attempts to amend the legislation in any form, Conservative MPs voiced their concerns in large numbers on a range of issues.\nA proposal which would have allowed civil registrars to opt out of presiding over gay marriages on grounds of conscience was backed by 150 MPs - including Cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson - although 340 voted against.\nIn a subsequent vote, 148 MPs supported an amendment to protect the religious beliefs of a person who believes that marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman but 349 MPs voted against.\nStonewall, which campaigns for equality for gay, lesbian and bisexual people, said it would be a \"terrible pity\" if the legislation got \"bogged down\" and urged MPs from all parties not to \"play politics\" with it.\nUnder the bill, the Church of England and the Church in Wales would be banned from offering same-sex marriages because of their strongly stated opposition, unless they changed canon law.\nOther religious organisations would be able to \"opt in\" to holding ceremonies.

{"document": "Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen's elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo.\nBut her smile fades as she describes her own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six-hour shifts, she was told to go back to eight-hour days.\n\"I feel that I am more tired than I was before,\" she reflects, lamenting the fact that she now has less time at home to cook or read with her four-year-old daughter.\n\"During the trial all the staff had more energy. I could see that everybody was happy.\"\nMs Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes.\nDesigned to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours.\nThe project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days.\nTheir final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments.\nDuring the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs.\nHowever, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits.\nCentre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable.\nSaved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (\u00c2\u00a31.1m; $1.3m).\n\"Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,\" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care.\nBut he argues the experiment still proved \"successful from many points of view\" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture.\n\"It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,\" he says.\n\"In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that.\"\nYet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim.\nOn a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election.\nNevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses.\nCleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month.\nThere's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept.\nYet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea.\n\"I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world,\" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company.\nHe is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after \"reading about the trend on Facebook\" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent.\nBut the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees.\n\"I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful,\" says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company.\n\"It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up.\"\nOn the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns.\n\"I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home.\n\"It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,\" he suggests.\n\"This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home.\"\nBack in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses.\n\"A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver,\" he says.\n\"Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers.\"\n\"So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours.\n\"First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups.\n\"It could be to do with working hours and working times, but it could be a lot of other things as well.\"\nListen to Maddy Savage's report on Sweden's experiment with six-hour days on The World Tonight.", "summary": "Sweden has been experimenting with six-hour days, with workers getting the chance to work fewer hours on full pay, but now the most high-profile two-year trial has ended - has it all been too good to be true?", "id": "38843341"}

We don't want to see a divided country after the age of 11,\" Sir Michael said.\nMore than 400,000 pupils in the North and Midlands go to a school that is \"less than good\", and the Ofsted chief said this could not be \"explained away\" by higher levels of deprivation.\nPrimary schools were much more successful than secondary, Sir Michael said, despite facing similar problems of social disadvantage.\nHe also used the example of London to show how deprivation need not be inevitably linked to lower results.\nSir Michael called for greater \"political will\" and more attention to improve the quality of teaching.\n\"We've seen a significant difference in the quality of teaching between the South and the Midlands and the North, a significant difference in terms of the quality of leadership... and we need to worry about this as a nation,\" he said.\n\"The mediocrity in secondary performance should be a national concern - and the mediocrity is residing mainly, but not exclusively, in the Midlands and north of England.\n\"If the 'northern powerhouse' is going to mean something, then we've got to improve educational performance in our secondary schools north of the Wash.\"\nSir Michael also warned that problems were being exacerbated by difficulties in recruiting teachers - and that schools in challenging areas could have the toughest time finding enough teachers in some subjects.\nRecruitment problems were having a \"significant impact\", said the Ofsted chief.\nWatchsted, a website that gathers inspections data, ranks local authorities in terms of the proportion of schools rated as \"outstanding\" or \"good\".\nThe bottom 10 at secondary school level includes northern authorities such as Knowsley, Bradford, Oldham, Blackpool and Doncaster - but also the Isle of Wight and Cambridgeshire.\nEight out of the top 10 authorities at secondary level are in London or the South East.\n\"More and more we are seeing that schools facing the biggest challenges are now in coastal and market towns, rather than large cities. And children from low income families have the greatest barriers,\" said James Westhead, executive director of Teach First.\nMost secondary schools in England now have academy status - but the annual report says that in terms of raising standards \"structural reform can only do so much\".\nAnd it highlights that being an academy does not \"insulate\" schools from decline, with 99 academies that had been good or outstanding being regraded as less than good.\nRoy Perry, chairman of the children and young people board at the Local Government Association, said ranking councils by school results \"disguises the fact that over 60% of secondary schools are now academies, leaving councils powerless to intervene early and build an improvement programme\".\n\"It is extremely worrying that over the last three years only 37% of secondary schools have actually improved their Ofsted rating after becoming academies.\"\nThe Ofsted report also highlights that pupils' progress up to the end of primary is too often not sustained when they move to secondary.\nThis was revealed last month in an analysis of this summer's GCSE results, by education data company, SchoolDash.\nThis mapped the growing north-south divide at GCSE level, but also showed there was much less of a gap in primary school.\nHead teachers' leader Brian Lightman linked the north-south gap to the \"very serious difficulties\" that schools faced in recruiting teachers.\nMr Lightman, head of the ASCL head teachers' union, said schools in challenging areas were finding it \"incredibly hard\" to find teachers in some shortage subjects, particularly affecting schools in some parts of the North.\nRussell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the gap between primary and secondary performance had been \"driven by the turmoil at secondary compared to primary\", such as the upheavals in exams and curriculum.\nEducation Secretary Nicky Morgan said: \"More needs to be done to deliver educational excellence everywhere.\"\n\"That's why we are introducing new measures to transform failing and coasting schools, funding the best academy chains to share excellence in struggling regions in the North and creating a National Teaching Service - sending some of our best teachers to the areas that need them most.\"", "summary": "Ofsted is warning of a north-south divide in England's secondary schools.", "id": "34964522"}

You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets.\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent\".\nRetired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says.\n\"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds.\nBricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\"\nOthers, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\"\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk.\n\"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\"\nSir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe.\n\"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\"\nThe commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock.\nIt comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.", "summary": "More armed police are to be seen on patrol in London, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan have said.", "id": "36961338"}

{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe fact the cost of watching football in Britain has mostly remained the same or even become cheaper, suggests pressure from supporters and government has finally had an impact after the ticket price inflation of recent seasons, along with clubs becoming more prepared to pass on more of their ever-increasing broadcast rights revenues to their customers.\nHowever, it appears the sport is still becoming more expensive for the poorest fans who want to go and watch occasional matches.\nThe average price of the cheapest match-day ticket has gone through the \u00a330 barrier for the first time in the Premier League, a rise of 6.5%. Across the top five leagues of English football the cost is \u00a322. And while inflation seems to have eased for season tickets, fans still face increasing expense when it comes to official merchandise.\nLast year, the then sports minister Helen Grant told me she was \"cross and concerned\" about ticket prices, and asked clubs to review their customer strategy after it was revealed the average price of the cheapest tickets had risen at almost twice the rate of inflation since 2011.\nThat led to fears that clubs had lost touch with some fans, and ran the risk of pricing some traditional supporters out of the game, along with younger fans. It looks like that message has partially got through, because we now learn that 70% of tickets (two-thirds in the Premier League) have been frozen or even reduced this year.\nClick here to play with the Price of Football calculator and see what your support is costing you.\nThe Premier League has grown increasingly frustrated with surveys focusing on ticket prices, believing they are too simplistic and fail to take into account the complexities of pricing structure, along with various initiatives.\nThey also point to the fact that crowds are as healthy as ever, with record 96% occupancy at stadiums and that 40% of those attending are aged 18-34.\nHence, the Premier League recently published its own research, showing that season ticket holders - who make up two-thirds of top-flight crowds - paid an average of \u00a332.50 for adults and just \u00a310 for juniors.\nThe Football League also says it rewards loyalty with average price paid per spectator as low as \u00a314 across the 72 member clubs.\nSome clubs do more than others, of course. At Everton for example, the average price for a season ticket has fallen in real terms by 23% over the last 10 years, with under-11s paying just \u00a35 per game.\nSome will see that all this as decent value for one of the most compelling leagues in the world, comparing favourably with other sporting events and entertainment.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOthers, however, will argue that in a period of almost zero inflation, and after the Premier League announced the biggest TV deal in football history in February, worth some \u00a35.136 billion (a 70% increase), freezing ticket prices is the least they should be doing.\nThis all comes at a time of continued anger by some fans at the prices they are expected to pay. In 2013, Man City supporters protested at being charged \u00a362 for tickets at Emirates Stadium, and there have been a number of demonstrations and marches at spiralling costs ever since.\nThe Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) has been calling for more affordable tickets with its 'Twenty's Plenty' campaign, designed to lobby clubs to cap prices for away fans at \u00a320.\nSwansea City already caps away tickets for their supporters at \u00a322, with other clubs committing to a range of reciprocal deals over certain fixtures. The FSF says if each club contributed \u00a31m per season, its \u00a320 price target could be met for all away fans. It also says that the Premier League clubs should use some of the \u00a324m they saved on unpaid parachute payments to Norwich City, after the club bounced back to the Premier League following relegation.\nTo be fair, the Premier League has listened. This is the third season of its Away Fans Fund, which sees each club set aside \u00a3200,000 every year to help subsidise tickets and transport costs for travelling supporters.\nThe FSF says it is pleasantly surprised by the way the clubs have engaged, and \u00a3738,000 has now been saved for the country's 70,000 Premier League regular away fans through the scheme. That works out at about \u00a310 for each supporter.\nHowever, at a time when some top players get paid \u00a3200,000 for around five days work, and when the cost of watching live football on TV is more expensive than anywhere else in Europe, the FSF now wants the Premier League to go much further.\nIt makes the point that the additional revenue from the \u00a35bn domestic television deal alone (with the forthcoming overseas TV deal expected to result in an another \u00a33bn) equates to \u00a346 for every fan at every game.\nThere is mounting evidence, however, that the Premier League is willing to redistribute more of its wealth and play a greater role in society.\nAlthough some want more, clubs have committed to share \u00a31bn over the three years of the new TV deal, with 'fan engagement' one of five areas set to benefit.\nClubs have already promised to pay the living wage for their staff, improve facilities for disabled fans, and have agreed to expand a school sport programme to every primary school in England and Wales. I'm told the clubs intend to do more to help with ticket affordability but want to wait to see how much is generated from their overseas TV rights deal, and the result of an Ofcom investigation into how those TV rights are sold.\nBut the price of football is about more than just tickets.\nThe BBC study found that the 20 Premier League clubs brought out 50 new strips this season - 10 clubs putting new third kits on sale.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAll the teams now change their strips each year. The average cost of an adult shirt in the Premier League is now almost \u00a350 thanks to a 4.82% increase in the average price this season, with 10 clubs putting their prices up. A full adult strip at Manchester United would set you back \u00a3118 (a junior kit is \u00a3103).\nThe clubs say this is driven by consumer demand, but others believe supporters are being taken advantage of.\nThe top clubs have to compete with wealthy European rivals like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain for the world's best playing talent, and after another season of disappointing Champions League performances by English representatives, the need to maximise match-day revenue to sustain on-field performance is a persuasive one. After all, the clubs are businesses, geared to providing the best football competition, not charities.\nOn the other hand, critics can point to the \u00a3115m that clubs paid in agents' fees last year alone, and are entitled to ask whether ticket prices are still too expensive, especially when compared to some leagues abroad, including Germany and Spain - where a season ticket at Barcelona can be picked up for as little as \u00a378 (on top of an annual membership fee).\nMany feel that football is unlike any other business and fans should be treated as more than mere customers.

Some fans then climbed across barriers designed to keep rival fans apart.\nRussia's Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said on Sunday: \"We will have a fine from Uefa, so I understand. We behaved incorrectly,\" R-Sport news agency reported.\nBut he added there were \"many nuances\" to what happened, and Russian officials would investigate.\nNed Ozkasim, from London, who was in the stadium, told the BBC: \"There was a large explosion, and after the Russian goal they started invading the area where some England fans were.\n\"I didn't see any retaliation from the England fans - they were just trying to get away.

There were just stewards in hi-vis, and they just let it happen.\"\nEuro 2016: 'England fans are not idiots'\nFrom the moment England and Russia fans started flooding into Marseille on Thursday and Friday, there was an undercurrent of tension and violence that was transformed into scenes that were a throwback to some of football's worst hooligan excesses of the past.\nIn the steamy, humid environment of this port city in the south of France, with alcohol flowing freely in searing temperatures and demonstrations of aggression from both sets of fans, all the ingredients were in place for events that unfolded in the Vieux-Port de Marseille.\nAs a long, hot Saturday wore on towards a late kick-off at 21:00 local time, the scenery shifted to the magnificent, sweeping curves of the Stade Velodrome, culminating in the disgraceful incidents that took place just seconds after full-time.\nIt was particularly disturbing given the high levels of security and policing that were in evidence around the stadium as the authorities remain on high alert after November's Paris attacks. Security, here at least, seemed in very short supply.\nIt was the sort of hooliganism the game's rulers hoped had been stamped out but has reared its head in sinister fashion less than 48 hours into Euro 2016.

{"document": "I'd been selected as one of 24 mid-career professionals from around the world to take up a Rotary International peace fellowship.\nIt involved three months studying peace and conflict at Chulalongkorn University, in Thailand.\nMy classmates would be peacekeepers who had seen war and conflict up close. They were professors and activists from places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Nepal.\nThe hope was we'd graduate brimming with solutions to help a world that, let's face it, needs people minded to try to find peace where they can.\nBut I'd only been in Bangkok two days when I realised I had a problem.\nAs I looked down after seven hours of exploring the streets, I saw my feet, swollen in the heat, were bleeding - cut to pieces by my seven-year-old weathered sandals.\nWith temperatures set to rise, and school starting early the next morning, I had to buy new footwear.\nThey had to be respectable, so my trainers wouldn't cut it.\nWe had been warned before we came out that Thailand was still in the midst of a year-long mourning period for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.\nMy outfits, therefore, had to be suitable from head to toe, especially since I was attending the royal university.\nI left my room in a rush and spotted a chap in my dorm corridor.\n\"Are you new? Are you a Rotary fellow too? Want to help me buy shoes?\" Andrew Miles, a policeman from Melbourne, knew when he had been ambushed.\nFifteen minutes later, we found ourselves in the midst of the MBK shopping centre.\nTen minutes after that and 500 baht (\u00c2\u00a311) poorer, I had in my hand two pairs of sandals that could easily be slipped off at temples and people's homes, as the Thai culture required, and could also cope with swelling feet in Bangkok's rising heat.\nGlobal education\nGet in touch with the Global education series.\nThe sandals certainly got a battering.\nAs a vegetarian, Bangkok's street food proved a bit of challenge.\nLesson one: to find peace, learn as much of the language of the country you've moved to as quickly as you can - especially when it comes to meal time.\nThis will prevent \"hanger\" (when you get angry because you are so hungry).\nLesson two: be ready to walk, and walk and walk as you try to find somewhere that can cater for your strict dietary requirements.\nBe careful of getting overexcited by meal spots, as you may end up tripping over your toes.\nI can testify that falling flat on your bottom on Bangkok's incredibly busy streets is not a good look.\nAt first, things went well.\nSchool was a 10-minute walk away, and guest lecturers included Buddhist monks, military generals and academics with years of experience in peace studies.\nTopics included storytelling and peace and conflict analysis tools.\nFriendships and bonds emerged through this unique programme.\nWhere else would a London journalist like me end up sharing washing powder with Natasha Dimitrovska - a feminist from Macedonia - or have daily morning coffee with Manty Hasan- a peace activist living in Aceh, Indonesia?\nI was following in the footsteps of more than 400 peace fellows who had studied peace and conflict at the Thailand centre.\nBut those shoes were not what I thought I'd bargained for.\nThe rubber soles on one pair gave away in the heat and when you live a student life, you revert to cheap fixes.\nOne message I sent to the group's WhatsApp chat included: \"I accidently superglued my sandal to the floor; anyone got any nail polish remover I could borrow?\"\nOne day, Travis Burke, an American classmate who had worked in war zones, sewed together my other pair of broken sandals with a travel kit he had had the foresight to bring with him.\nLesson three: a needle and thread is a life-essential for any emerging cracks.\nDesigner Christian Louboutin has called shoes a \"communication tool between people\", and that leads to lesson four.\nResolving conflict is about finding things in common.

I have selected seven of the key players:\nHe wants to continue occupying the residence he has known since childhood when his father, Jomo Kenyatta, was president - namely State House.\nIn other words he wants to be re-elected president for a second five-year term in the coming general election.\nHe has been forced to accept that he negotiate a way out of the impasse with the opposition.\nBut he wants this dialogue to be conducted through a parliamentary process, because he \"swore to uphold and defend the constitution\".\nWhat he does not want is a street solution.\nHe saw what the Arab Spring did to those in power.\nHe has vowed to crack down hard on hate speech and his government has not spared leaders accused of spreading ethnic hatred.\nThe authorities have made the eight MPs arrested an example by denying them bail and forcing them to suffer in the infamous cold and miserable police cells for three nights.\nPoster boy of the opposition, he leads the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord), an umbrella grouping of several political parties.\nMr Odinga wants what his late father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga tried and failed to achieve for many years - enter State House.\nAmong other things he wants a total overhaul of the electoral commission and direct appointment of the commissioners.\nHe believes the body as currently constituted is not credible and cannot oversee a credible electoral process in 2017.\nHe does not want reforms through a parliamentary process.\nHe knows very well the current government has enough numbers in the house to frustrate his efforts.\nHe is the MP for Gatundu South, a constituency in central Kenya that has produced two presidents - Jomo Kenyatta and Uhuru Kenyatta.\nHe is Kenya's Donald Trump (minus the billions and the presidential ambition): Straight-talking, unpredictable and uncontrollable.\nHe wants the opposition to tremble in their boots as they prepare for dialogue.\nFor the umpteenth time Mr Kuria is in trouble and facing serious charges of hate speech.\nMany Kenyans view him as the government's kamikaze - a force of self-destruction that also conveniently distracts attention from the ruling establishment.\nHe is the senator for Machakos County and a prominent opposition voice.\nHe is wealthy, loud and bold.\nHe will say the unsayable and often makes the government quite uncomfortable.\nMr Muthama is one of the eight legislators who were arrested for hate speech.\nHe is the chairman and face of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).\nHe does not want to go home - at least not yet.\nHe wants both government and the opposition to leave him and his team alone to continue preparing for next year's election, arguing that a change of guard now will have a negative impact on the 2017 elections.\nIt is a non-lethal chemical weapon that irritates the eyes, mouth, lungs and skin.\nIn Kenya, it is personified by the cabinet secretary in charge of internal security, Joseph Nkaissery.\nThe former military man talks and acts tough.\nIn mid-May he cautioned opposition protesters: \"Let them be warned that I have enough tear gas - which I will not run short of soon - to use in smoking them out of IEBC offices if they attempt to force themselves there.\"\nThroughout Kenya's history, in the absence of talks to resolve political disputes, tear gas talks.\nI have personal experience of this having inhaled enough tear gas as a student and journalist -

{"document": "There have been huge battery-related recalls before - Nokia had to ask consumers to send back 46 million batteries in 2007 because of overheating fears, but because they were removable it did not mean a well-reviewed flagship had to be scrapped.\n\"Stop using your device, back up your data and switch it off,\" the Samsung told Note 7 owners the day after it confirmed it had shut down its assembly lines following a spate of fires.\nA compensation scheme is being put in place - users will be offered the choice of either getting all their money back or swapping the phablet for an older, smaller-screened Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge phone plus a partial refund.\nBut several questions remain unanswered.\nWhen Samsung instituted the initial recall last month, it pointed to a \"battery cell issue\" being the cause.\nA report sent by the company to regulators was more specific, saying a production fault had caused some of the batteries to be slightly larger than intended, which had put pressure on them when they were fitted inside phones, according to a leak reported by Bloomberg.\nThe issue was blamed on the components' manufacturer - Samsung SDI  - and was supposed to have been fixed by putting  batteries made by another company, ATL, in the replacements.\nNow that several of that second batch of phones have overheated too, it is unclear whether the original problem was misdiagnosed.\nAccording to the New York Times, Samsung's engineers were never able to get the phones to explode when they tried to recreate the fault.\n\"We are working with relevant regulatory bodies to investigate the recently reported cases involving the Galaxy Note 7,\" was the only comment a Samsung spokesman was willing to make on the matter.\nSamsung has yet to reveal exactly how many Note 7s it made before pulling the plug on Tuesday.\nOn 2 September, the South Korean company said 2.5 million devices were subject to its initial recall.\nOn 27 September, it added that more than 60% of the Note 7s that had been sold in South Korea and the US had been replaced with new devices.\nThose two countries accounted for the vast majority of the phones sold - only about 50,000 devices made it to Europe.\nAnd the Note 7 only briefly returned to sale to new customers in South Korea last week.\nAll of which gives a rough tally of four million units.\nIHS had originally forecast Samsung would have made about six million Note 7s by this point if all had gone according to plan.\nIt is less clear how many actually overheated\nSamsung said it had received \"35 reported claims\" at the time of the first recall, and there were seven reports in the media of replacement models being affected.\nSamsung has said it will take \"all measures\" to get the devices back.\nFor now, that involves sending emails and notifications to registered users.\nAt the time of the original recall, it also issued a software update that prevented some of the batteries from being fully recharged.\nThere is speculation that other restrictions - or a full lockout - could be imposed if users now refuse to give the devices up.\nThere is also the question of what Samsung does with the mountain of returned mobiles.\nA spokesman declined to say whether it might strip them down and re-use components in other products.\nBut one environmental pressure group urged it act responsibly.\n\"Mobile phones have valuable and precious materials within them, the mining for which can cause significant environmental harm - and can sometimes be carried out in appalling working conditions in developing countries,\" said Friends of the Earth's policy director, Mike Childs.\n\"All phones should be 100% recycled at the end of their lives, or when they have to be returned due to faults.\n\"The environment shouldn't suffer because of the mistakes of  mobile phone firms.\"\nMany consumers bought cases, a Blackberry-styled keyboard cover, a wide-angle lens attachment and spare styluses and power packs for their Note 7s.\nA spokesman for Samsung said it was still in discussions with vendors about how to cover these costs.\nSome owners are also wondering if they will be offered extra cash for handing back the second-generation Gear VR virtual reality headset that was bundled with pre-orders.\nIt costs abut \u00c2\u00a3100 to buy separately.\nThe spokesman said the company considered this to have been a \"gift\" but did not rule out some kind of additional compensation.\nSamsung's Galaxy line-up used to distinguish itself against Apple's iPhones by allowing users to take off the phones' backs and swap out their batteries.\nBut the S6 and Note 5 phones changed that, helping Samsung offer more compact designs with added water resistance as a bonus.\nSome people have pointed out Samsung might have avoided its current problems if it had not made that choice.\nAnd it is notable its domestic rival LG has included removable batteries in its two current top-end models.\nUnsurprisingly, Samsung would not comment on its future designs.\nBut one expert said all smartphone-makers would be reviewing their plans.\n\"There are greater power demands on modern smartphones - they have bigger, higher-resolution screens, faster processors, and 4G data - but there is also greater pressure to keep them very compact and also enable owners to charge them quickly,\" said Ian Fogg, from IHS.\n\"Those are competing demands.\n\"Everyone will be looking at their forthcoming smartphone launches and tasking their engineering teams to have another look at the way their charging and the batteries work to make sure they don't have the same problem.\n\"And Samsung will be looking at its upcoming models in a particularly close way, as it's possible they were set to share some of the same design elements as the Note 7.\"", "summary": "Samsung's second recall of its Galaxy Note 7 handsets is an unprecedented disaster for the company and the wider mobile phone sector.", "id": "37630605"}

He has been named as Anders Behring Breivik. Police searched his Oslo apartment overnight and are questioning him.\nThe BBC's Richard Galpin, near the island which is currently cordoned off by police, says that Norway has had problems with neo-Nazi groups in the past but the assumption was that such groups had been largely eliminated and did not pose a significant threat.\nPolice say they are investigating whether the attacks were the work of one man or whether others helped.\n\"At Utoeya, the water is still being searched for more victims,\" deputy police chief Roger Andresen told reporters.\n\"We have no more information than... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\"\nBy Richard GalpinBBC News, near Utoeya\nA search is going on not just on the island itself, but also in the waters around it because a lot of people tried to escape by jumping in the water and trying to swim away. Even as they did that, eyewitnesses say, the gunman opened fire on them.\nThe chatter now is that it took the police an hour, if not an hour and a half, to actually get to the island.

{"document": "In 2015, voter turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated to be 43%, compared with a 66.1% turnout overall. This year, YouGov puts the youth turnout at 58%.\nPolling traditionally shows that a majority of young people vote Labour.  This year, the proportion has jumped to 63% for 18-29-year-olds, according to YouGov.\nSo how did this change happen?\nSam Jeffers, co-founder of Who Targets Me, which monitored the use of social media adverts by the political parties during the general election, said it seemed clear that Labour defeated the Conservatives in the social media battle.\nLabour's adverts had consistently been shared more widely by social media users, he said.\nPart of this appears to be down to the difference in tone of the adverts.\nWhile the Conservatives had almost entirely focused their adverts on the strength of Prime Minister Theresa May and the weakness of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour's social media adverts had been more positive, seeking to emphasise that the party was building a social movement, he said.\nAnd this had been combined with the repeated use of adverts with practical messages designed to increase youth voter turnout by giving instructions on how to register to vote and where to find local polling stations.\nAdverts also appeared to have been released on specific days on the basis that their message was likely to cut through for only a limited amount of time, Mr Jeffers said.\nFor example, Labour had invested heavily on adverts attacking the Tories' so-called \"dementia tax\" on social care costs, days before the 8 June election.\nThe aim of this appeared to be to suppress the older, potentially Conservative, vote or get them to switch to Labour at the last minute, Mr Jeffers said.\nLabour also focused its attention on more of the UK, targeting 464 constituencies in the final two days of the election campaign. The Tories targeted 205.\nWas it Facebook wot swung it?\nWhile the Labour Party paid for targeted adverts on social media, Momentum - the group that was set up to support Mr Corbyn's leadership bid and now campaigns for Labour - had a different social media strategy.\nRather than pay for advertising, it instead sought to create content it hoped social media users would share voluntarily.\nThe group created videos - many of them parodies - it hoped would become viral.\nThese included Daddy, why do you hate me? - a mock political broadcast telling people to vote for Theresa May \"because your children deserve worse\" - which Momentum says has been viewed more than 7.6 million times across social media platforms.\nIts Facebook and Twitter pages feature a mixture of content, from posts mocking Theresa May's record to videos of Mr Corbyn hugging some of his supporters.\nJoe Todd, from Momentum, said the group had felt its strategy was working when it had realised many of the people sharing its content were not typical supporters of Mr Corbyn.\nIncreasingly, users liking its Facebook page had been people who also liked the pages of TV programmes not known for their political audiences, such as Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway and Match of the Day, he said.\n\"We were breaking out of the leftie bubble,\" Mr Todd said.\nUsing message services to reach the young - and in some cases mobilising them into an army of potential canvassers - had been important in reaching the youth vote, Mr Todd said.\nMomentum says it reached some 400,000 people through the messaging platform WhatsApp, which data shows is used most by 18-to 29-year-olds, in the UK.\nThe group also set up mynearestmarginal.com - a website that enables activists to pool together, and often lift share, to canvass in marginal seats.\nMomentum says the website was used by about 100,000 people - more than four times as many as its 24,000 membership.\nThis meant young people with no experience of canvassing could team up with those with previous election experience for targeted canvassing.\n\"If you have a young person telling another young person, 'You should get out and vote because this election is important', it's more convincing,\" Mr Todd said.\nThere was also an unashamed pitch for the youth vote at the heart of Labour's manifesto For the Many, Not the Few - and that was the eye-catching promise of scrapping tuition fees for university students and the pledge to reintroduce their maintenance grants.\nFurther policies pitched with the young in mind included the ending of zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships, a rise in the minimum wage, and a pledge to build more than one million homes.\nOf course, Labour wasn't the only party that targeted young people and it's hard to quantify the effect of the manifesto in getting the young out to vote, but Mr Todd felt it was among the most significant factors.\n\"It conjured up a sense of hope,\" he said.\nThe Labour campaign also featured large rallies that accompanied Jeremy Corbyn's speeches around the country.\nMr Corbyn had been a long-standing supporter of the protest movement, and the veteran anti-war campaigner was well placed to appeal to a growing number of young people who had become engaged in politics through these movements, according to Sam Fairbairn, national secretary of the People's Assembly protest group.\nAlthough the People's Assembly does not endorse individual parties or candidates, Mr Fairbairn said the group - and its numerous local affiliates and sister organisations - had encouraged members to join Mr Corbyn's campaign rallies.\n\"It's no accident Jeremy has been part of these movements since he's been in politics. This is how many young people have got into politics in the last 10 years,\" Mr Fairbairn said.\n\"What we saw was the result of the work all these movements have done.\"\nA string of endorsements from anti-establishment celebrities and musicians, including from the world of grime - a genre of music that blends garage and jungle and  has a Jamaican influence - also, arguably, further bolstered Mr Corbyn's youth credentials.\nMr Corbyn also took part in interviews with outlets - such as rock magazines NME and Kerrang, and football YouTube channel Copa90 - outside of the political mainstream that were more likely to reach younger audiences.\nBecka Hudson, from the #Grime4Corbyn campaign, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Mr Corbyn had \"offered young people a programme they can believe in and a better future\".\nThe question is what happens next with that youth support.\nIs there the danger the young will be discouraged by the election result and be less likely to turn out at the next election, whenever that may be?\nMr Todd thinks the opposite is the case.\n\"For most people this project was something they believed in, but it seemed like it might not be possible. Now the prospect of victory is really realistic,\" he said.", "summary": "A boosted youth vote is believed to have contributed to Labour's shock election result, but what made young people turn out to vote?", "id": "40244905"}

There's not even sprinklers in there.\n\"In 2009, the last block was on fire. What has changed since then? Nothing. Enough is enough, I have got friends in that tower. I have a right to be angry. Because of people saving money, people are dying.\"\nFormer Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said it was \"not OK\" for the prime minister to go to the area but not meet residents, and called on her to invite them to talk to her in Downing Street, as victims of the 2009 Lakanal House fire had been.\nBut on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday, Conservative defence minister Tobias Ellwood said there were \"security reasons\" why Mrs May had not met residents.\nAnd former housing minister Mark Prisk said Mrs May would not have wanted \"to bring the whole weight of the media circus down on families who are going through some pretty grim days\".\nBut BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said there would be questions about why the Queen was able to make such a visit, and the prime minister was not.\nDowning Street said that Mrs May's visit on Thursday had been made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed.\nOn Friday, Mrs May visited the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital which is treating eight people, three of whom are in critical care.\nCommunities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC on Friday there would be immediate action following early conclusions from an investigative report into the fire.\n\"We need to do whatever it takes to make people that live in those properties safe: that's either make the properties safe or find some other accommodation, it has to be done,\" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"In this country, in this century, for this kind of thing to happen it is horrific and we cannot allow anything like this to ever happen again.\"\nCouncils say they are carrying out urgent reviews of high-rise buildings in their areas in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire.\nThe chairman of the Local Government Association, which represent about 150 councils in England, said councils were reviewing fire risk assessments and the construction of buildings along with partners.", "summary": "A large police presence held back angry crowds outside a Kensington church where Theresa May was meeting victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster.", "id": "40300369"}

US and other Western embassies have come under attack in mainly Muslim countries.\nForeign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was \"concerned\" at the cartoons and had ordered \"special security measures... in all the countries where this [publication] could pose a problem\".\nBy Christian FraserBBC News, Paris\nThe French schools are already closed in Tunisia. In Libya, French journalists are withdrawing from known hotels. And in the Muslim community of Belleville in Paris, they have been buying the latest edition of Charlie Hebdo just to rip it up.\nNo wonder the French authorities are concerned. The foreign minister acted quickly this morning in an attempt to suppress the anger, while articulating the government's frustrations. The decision to print the cartoons at a time when Western embassies are already threatened, he said, would only \"add fuel to the fire\".\nLast night Charb, the editor of Charlie Hebdo, told me he rejected criticism that he was inciting violence, putting French lives at risk. He was using the cartoons, he said, to make fun of the film rather than the Prophet. But he would know what the reaction would be. Even as he left his offices last night, the riot police were there, on stand-by as a precaution. And this morning the magazine's website was hacked.\nThe French authorities have turned down an application from the Muslim community for a demonstration on Saturday. The request was initially lodged in response to the controversial American film. Mr Fabius says he \"sees no reason to allow conflicts that do not concern France into the country\". But the government's decision is harder to defend now that the magazine has decided to publish, though clearly there are public order issues. These are highly offensive images, even to non-Muslims.\nThe closures relate to possible protests following weekly Muslim prayers.\nNo list of countries affected was immediately available. However, the following measures have been put in place:\nA statement about the cartoons on the French foreign ministry's website quotes Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault as saying \"freedom of expression is one of [France's] fundamental principles\", as are secularism and respect for religious convictions.\n\"And this is why, in the current context, the prime minister would like to express his disapproval of any excesses,\" the statement adds.\nBut US White House spokesman Jay Carney expressed concern at the decision to publish the cartoons, comparing them to the Innocence of Muslims video which caused uproar in last week.\n\"We know that these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential to be inflammatory,\" he said.\n\"We don't question the right of something like this to be published, we just question the judgement behind the decision to publish it and I think that's our view about the video that was produced in this country and has caused so much offence in the Muslim world.\"\nMuslim leaders urged calm in France, which has the EU's largest Muslim community - about 10% of the population.\n\"This is a disgraceful and hateful, useless and stupid provocation,\" Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Paris Grand Mosque, told the Associated Press news agency before meeting Mr Valls.\nCharlie Hebdo, known in France for its scatological cartoons, has caricatured other religious figures in the past, including a \"Pope special\" in 2008 which resulted in an unsuccessful court action accusing the magazine of inciting hate.\nOne of the milder cartoons in Wednesday's edition, the cover image, shows an Orthodox Jew pushing a turbaned figure in a wheelchair, with the caption \"You mustn't mock\".\nAmong the explicit cartoons inside, one clearly parodies the topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge which appeared in Closer magazine, and resulted in an injunction on Tuesday.\nThe editor-in-chief of the magazine, Gerard Biard, told the BBC's World Have Your Say programme they had published the cartoons because the protests about the film were newsworthy.\n\"These publications will not cost lives,\" he said. \"Who killed people? We are not killing people, I'm sorry. We are not the violent ones.\"\nMagazine editor Stephane \"Charb\" Charbonnier said earlier: \"I'm not asking strict Muslims to read Charlie Hebdo, just like I wouldn't go to a mosque to listen to speeches that go against everything I believe.\"\nIn November, the magazine's offices in Paris were gutted by a petrol bomb attack after it named the Prophet Muhammad as its \"editor-in-chief\" for an issue.", "summary": "Security has been increased at France's interests abroad after a French satirical magazine published obscene cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.", "id": "19646748"}
{"document": "Warning: Readers may find some of the details of violence in this piece distressing.\nIt was late October 2014, and on paper the young banker had lived what could only be described as a privileged and successful life. But over the space of a few drug- and alcohol-fuelled days, he tortured and killed Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, before calling the police to let them know what he had done.\nIn court, lawyers described a much darker side to his apparently gilded existence, one involving drugs, sexual sadism, and an extreme personality disorder.\nJutting had tortured Ms Ningsih for three days, before he killed her by slashing her throat over a prolonged period, nearly decapitating her. He then hid her body in a suitcase.\nA few days later, Jutting brought his second victim, Ms Mujiasih, to his flat. This was a woman he would go on to describe simply as \"the prey\" he had been hunting.\n\"Sumarti was generous. That much is clear from the evidence in the house. Her driving force was to improve life for her family, to make them richer. Life may be peaceful in the village but she would have been all too aware of the possibilities of a life with more material comforts.\"\nThe story of Sumarti: Born in Indonesia, murdered in Hong Kong\nExperts for the defence say Jutting's IQ score is 137 - putting him in the top 1% of the population. But they also diagnosed him with four disorders, which they said combined to lead to the killings:\n\u2022Narcissistic personality disorder\n\u2022Sexual sadism disorder\n\u2022Cocaine use disorder\n\u2022Alcohol use disorder\nProsecution witnesses argued that such conditions should not \"substantially\" diminish his ability to control his actions. But according to the defence, when it came to his narcissism, the signs were there from an early age.\nJutting was born in London in 1985. His first name Rurik was chosen by his mother, and literally translated as \"great one\" - it was an imperial dynasty in Russia.\nHe described himself as an ambitious boy who had a happy childhood. But even from a young age, Jutting displayed feelings of superiority and entitlement, his defence argued. He was admitted to the prestigious private school Winchester College in his early teens but was disappointed that he ranked sixth in the scholarship selection, rather than first.\nWhen his mother expressed delight at his entrance exam results, Jutting commented that he found her reaction \"almost insulting\", because it implied that she was surprised he had got in.\nThere were other troubling episodes. When he was 16, his father tried to take his own life by slashing his wrists while he was in the house. Jutting had to help provide the initial care and go to hospital with him.\nJutting also said he had been sexually assaulted by another student while studying at Winchester. In 2003, he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said he experienced suicidal thoughts and that he was affected by knowledge of his parents' marital problems and concerns about his mother's health.\nNonetheless, Jutting excelled academically, being admitted to Cambridge University to study history and law at Peterhouse college. A fellow of the college, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC Mr Jutting was ambitious, a keen athlete, committed to his studies and from a stable Catholic background.\nBritish banker guilty of murders\nKilled by Jutting and forgotten by Indonesia\n'We were lucky it wasn't us' (video)\nJutting gained first class honours in his history degree but was disappointed to receive a 2:1 in law, and challenged the examiner's approach. The inability to accept criticism, psychiatrists said, was another sign of his narcissistic personality traits.\nOn graduation, Jutting worked at Barclays bank, before being head-hunted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. His role involved developing complex tax products and, within a few years, his salary had risen to \u00a3270,000 ($334,705) per year.\nBut then, things began to go wrong.\nIn 2012, while trying to market a tax product in Luxembourg, auditors began investigating his team for possible violation of regulations, flagging up Jutting in particular as a serious risk to the organisation.  Jutting described this as a \"negative turning point\" in his career and felt his move to Hong Kong the subsequent year had been arranged by bosses to get him out of the way.\nAt one point, his manager told Jutting he was one of the most unpredictable people he had ever worked with.\nJutting's alcohol use was also uncontrollable around this time, as he needed to drink excessive amounts in order to get to sleep. His then-girlfriend was so worried about his reliance on alcohol she banned him from drinking at home. He briefly saw a psychiatrist at this point, and said he often felt down and tearful at work.\nBy the time he had moved to Hong Kong in October 2013, he was consuming three quarters of a bottle of vodka to sleep and using cocaine. He said he smuggled cocaine up his rectum on his flight to Hong Kong.\nOnce in Hong Kong, he rented a flat in The J Residence, a luxury development in Wanchai popular with expatriate workers. Although located in a busy street in the heart of the city, the development gives off a sense of exclusivity.  Keycards are needed to access individual floors, while the sheer height of the building, at over 41 floors, means that residents can enjoy views of Hong Kong's skyline - from the bar, garden, and even swimming pool on the roof.\nBut Jutting described himself as feeling increasingly despondent and nihilistic in the city. He did not have much of a social life  and spent long periods drinking at home while playing computer games.\nJutting also had extreme sexual interests, and an obsession with sadistic pornography, experts said. He began using sex workers in 2009 and as time went on his behaviour became increasingly forceful. On a number of occasions, he removed condoms during sex without their consent, despite knowing this would constitute rape in the UK.\nJutting continued to fantasise about rape and kidnap even while he was remanded in a psychiatric centre after his arrest, prosecution expert Dr Kavin Chow said.\nBy 2014, he was \"spiralling out of control\". He would go on cocaine binges that lasted for days. At one point, he missed a scheduled meeting in London and, as an excuse, he told his boss he had HIV. He developed a round-the-clock craving for the drug, his weight ballooned and in the weeks before the killings took place he stopped going to work. Instead, he spent hours watching and reading violent pornography.\nHe attempted to find men on Grindr to have sex with, later telling a psychologist he had been \"trying to do everything I could to get new experiences\", but described everything as \"disappointing\".\nOn 25 October 2014 Jutting took Ms Ningsih to his flat, after offering to pay her for sex.\nThey had had sex on one occasion before, in a hotel, but things had got so violent that Ms Ningsih asked to end the session early, and refunded half his money. On this second occasion, the sex also switched from consensual to non-consensual, as Jutting began to beat Ms Ningsih.\nHe then held her captive, and tortured her using pliers, his belt, sex toys and his hands. He filmed some of the torture on his phone, in footage that was shown to the jury. The details that follow are distressing and brutal.\nJutting claims he drifted in and out of the influence of cocaine: \"When I became relatively less under the influence of cocaine I became quite apologetic - I told her repeatedly I loved her,\" he said in one police interview. Yet, in another interview, he said that he hadn't tortured Ms Ningsih as much as he would have liked, before killing her.\nHe killed her on the third day, after he made her kneel in front of the toilet bowl, with her hands tied behind her back, and lick the bowl. He then cut her throat with a knife but Ms Ningsih did not die immediately, so her dragged her into the shower and continued.\nJutting recorded several videos describing the aftermath of the killing on his phone.  Eventually, he wrapped up the body and placed it into a suitcase, which he left on the balcony.\nJutting began planning to torture a second victim on 31 October.  He bought tools, including sandpaper, nails and a blow torch, filming them on his iPhone, describing how he might use them to torture a victim.\nThat night, he went out and met Ms Mujiasih, inviting her back to his flat for sex. They began kissing and cuddling on the sofa but Ms Mujiasih began shouting when she saw a gag by the sofa. Jutting held a knife against her throat, telling her he would kill her if she continued to struggle. She continued struggling, and he killed her by slashing at her neck.\nHe later told police: \"She was simply, the word I'd use is prey. I was hunting for prey and she was unfortunately the person who was hunted\".\nAfter taking more cocaine, he says he contemplated taking his own life. He eventually called 999. He also called his boss, saying: \"I'm in a lot of trouble, you need to do something about the reputation of the bank.\"\nEven though he had not been to work in the two weeks leading up to the killings, the office was still on his mind.\nAfter he killed Ms Ningsih, he changed the out-of-office message from his work email to: \"I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody. [Last line only really worked if I had followed through..]\"\nOn one occasion, according to an expert witness, Jutting likened his life to The Truman Show, a movie starring Jim Carrey about a man who's entire life, unbeknownst to him, is a TV show.\nThis too may reflect his narcissism because Jutting wanted to believe that \"his life was so significant that\u2026 millions of people would be interested in watching it\".\nHe is now likely to spend much if not all of it in jail.", "summary": "On the 31st floor of an upmarket block of flats in Hong Kong's energetic Wanchai district, British banker Rurik Jutting brutally killed two Indonesian women in what would become known as one of the city's most notorious killings.", "id": "37845488"}
{"document": "For the media - both in Pakistan and abroad - the issue is clear enough: the Pakistani Taliban did it.\nNot only has the organisation claimed the attacks. but the intelligence service ISI also recorded real time messages from handlers to the gunmen in the school.\nThose messages, the ISI has told journalists, came from the phones of Afghan-based, Pakistani Taliban organisers.\nBut in Peshawar even people who witnessed the attack hesitate to blame the Taliban by name.\nThey not only fear reprisals but are also following the hesitancy of a political elite that remains largely unwilling to name and condemn the Pakistani Taliban in unequivocal terms.\nEven on the day of the Peshawar school massacre, the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, failed to condemn the Taliban by name. He referred only to \"terrorists\".\nAn alternative narrative relating the school attacks is already emerging: rumours are circulating on social media and on the streets that it was the work of Indian or Afghan intelligence agencies.\nThe fact that some of the attackers appear to have come from Central Asia lends weight to suggestions that there was a foreign hand in the attacks.\nThe emerging analysis of the school massacre echoes that which occurred after the shooting of Malala Yousafzai.\nInitial shock eventually transformed to the almost mainstream view in Pakistan today that Malala is a western stooge.\nThat's not to say the school massacre has had no impact on public opinion.\nWhen a radical cleric attempted to justify the attack this week, protestors gathered outside his mosque in Islamabad chanting anti Taliban slogans.\nThat's new. But there is still no big name politician prepared openly to lead people with that point of view.\nThat is in part because the Pakistan's civil and military elites are so divided and dysfunctional.\nThe politicians have a number of reasons for leaving the fight against the Pakistan Taliban (TTP) to the army.\nPrivately, government ministers argue that the army's total control of security policy means it is unreasonable for the generals to expect the civilians to take responsibility for what the army decides to do.\nThe politicians are anyway deeply suspicious of an army that has frequently mounted coups to overthrow elected governments.\nThe current Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was kicked out of power, put in a dungeon and then exiled by the last military ruler Pervez Musharraf.\nSharif believes that despite his overwhelming popular mandate the army has never accepted his political comeback in 2013 and is once again plotting to remove him from power.\nIn addition many politicians fear the Taliban.\nThe one party to attempt a political challenge to the Taliban in recent years, the Pashtun nationalist ANP, has faced relentless attacks on senior party cadres.\nThe ANP's stand was also politically disastrous.\nFar from perceiving the party as a valiant defender of liberal values, the electorate concluded the ANP was weak and unable to defend itself. The party now has just one member of the National Assembly.\nBut if the politicians loathe the generals, the feeling its entirely mutual.\nMany officers view Pakistani ministers and parliamentarians as corrupt and depraved, unwilling to put aside their lust for money and to focus instead on the plight of the country.\nThere is deep resentment in the army that when soldiers die in the fight against the Taliban, ministers do not make public speeches appreciating their sacrifices.\nMinisters rarely go to military hospitals to comfort soldiers injured in the fight against the Taliban.\nIt's estimated as many as 50,000 Pakistanis have been killed in political violence since 9/11.\nMembers of the security forces including both the army and the police account for around 10,000 of those deaths.\nSuccessive army chiefs have said that if they are to win the war against the TTP they need the politicians to lead Pakistani public opinion to support their military's campaign.\nBut while the army complains about the politician's failure to take clear line against the Taliban, others wonder how clear cut army policy is.\nThere are now well over 30 significant militant groups with a presence in Pakistan, each with different leadership structures, funding arrangements, ideological foundations and political goals.\nThe three most powerful are the Afghan Taliban, the TTP and the Punjab-based Lashkar-e-Taiba which concentrates its efforts on Kashmir and India.\nGiven the scale of problems faced by the Pakistan army, it is perhaps not surprising that it has decided to fight only those groups that are directly confronting it.\nThat means many Pakistani based militants are free to organise attacks on targets outside of Pakistan. For example, the anti Indian Lashkar-e-Taiba operates in Pakistan with little difficulty.\nWestern and Indian critics of the Pakistan army believe the army policy in fact goes much further.\nThey allege that the army does not just give some groups a free pass but, in fact, effectively controls them and uses them to advance the military's foreign policy goals.\nBy backing the Afghan Taliban, for instance, it ensures that the power of what Pakistan considers hostile elements such as the Tajiks is kept to a minimum or by backing Lashkar-e-Taiba it can advance the Pakistan cause in the disputed region of Kashmir.\nThe military strongly denies those claims.\nWhile the army clearly does distinguish between different militant groups there can be no doubt that for some years now it has been confronting the TTP.\nAnd its sometimes brutal campaign has had considerable success.\nIn 2009 the TTP had a high degree of control of 18 administrative units in north west Pakistan including some entire tribal areas.\nThe army campaign of the last few months pushed the TTP out of its last major redoubt in Pakistan; North Waziristan.\nThe TTP are now hemmed into to small pockets of territory in remote areas near the Afghan border,   and its leadership has been forced to take refuge in Afghanistan.\nSoon after the school massacre the Pakistan army chief Raheel Sharif went to Kabul to demand action against the Afghan-based TTP leader Mullah Fazlullah.\nHe took transcripts of the intercepted school massacre conversations with him.\nBut General Raheel Sharif's request is almost certain to run into a significant obstacle.\nIn return for moving against the TTP leadership on its soil, Afghanistan will expect Pakistan to move against any Afghan Taliban leaders sheltering in Pakistan.\nIt is believed that for many years now senior Afghan Taliban leaders have sought sanctuary in and around the Pakistani city of Quetta.\nSo once again Pakistani regional goals could undermine its fight for stability at home.\nThe army's desire to win more influence in Afghanistan through the Afghan Taliban could jeopardize its victories at home against the TTP.", "summary": "The vast majority of Pakistanis may be united in grief for the school children murdered in Peshawar  - but many say they still don't know who carried out the attacks.", "id": "30520596"}
{"document": "Mr Trump's 2018 budget blueprint reportedly includes a 37% spending cut for the State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID).\nHe will set out to convince Congress of his proposal in his first address to a joint session on Tuesday night.\nBut Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said his plan is \"dead on arrival\".\n\"It's not going to happen. It would be a disaster. If you take soft power off the table then you're never going to win the war,\" Senator Graham said.\nSoft power is an American term that refers to diplomatic tools such as foreign aid and humanitarian relief.\n\"What's most disturbing about the cut to the State Department's budget is it shows a lack of understanding of what it takes to win the war,\" Senator Graham continued.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said Mr Trump's reported deep cuts to the State Department would \"probably not\" pass Congress.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending.\nTo the White House, foreign aid might seem like an easy target for cuts, but those who protect the country think otherwise.\nIn their letter to lawmakers more than 120 former military officers quoted the Defence Secretary James Mattis from his days as a field commander: \"If you don't fully fund the State Department then I need to buy more ammunition.\"\nThey argued that strengthening diplomacy and development were critical to preventing conflict. International assistance in the State Department budget does more than respond to humanitarian needs, it also supports policy goals.\nFor example, it supplements the military fight against the so-called Islamic State through programmes to disrupt the group's financing and recruitment, and to stabilise communities where IS has been driven out.\nThere's money to address the underlying causes of migration from Central America, and to strengthen allies such as Afghanistan and Ukraine.\nThe former Secretary of State John Kerry was known to make a strong case for increasing the department's financing, (which at $50bn makes up just 1% of the entire budget).\nThe new Secretary Rex Tillerson will have to fight simply to keep what he has, or the State Department will be marginalised in an administration focused on the military.\nThe president released a budget proposal on Monday calling for a $54bn (\u00c2\u00a343bn) boost to military spending.\nThis would be paid for, according to the plan, by gutting other programmes including foreign aid and the environmental agency.\nThe White House also plans to reduce spending for the State Department and USAID,  say US media reports, which together received an estimated $50.1bn during the current fiscal year, or a little more than 1% of the total federal budget.\nMore than 120 retired generals have signed a letter urging Congress not to cut funding for diplomacy and foreign aid.\nThe letter said: \"As you and your colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018, we write as retired three and four star flag and general officers from all branches of the armed services to share our strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to keeping America safe.\"\nDevelopment assistance would probably be hardest hit while staff reductions would see fewer security contractors at diplomatic missions abroad, the AP reported, citing officials familiar with the proposal.\nThe Office of Management and Budget has not yet said where overall reductions would occur.\nThe Republican pushback over Mr Trump's reported plan comes as the president is set to deliver his first major speech to Congress since taking office.\nAn address to Congress is a different kind of presidential speech. Will the American public see a different Donald Trump?\nIf history is any guide, that seems unlikely. Every time there has been talk of a pivot or shift of focus for candidate Trump, or president-elect Trump, or President Trump, the end result has been the same Donald Trump as always - blustering and belligerent, unvarnished and unapologetic.\nMr Trump would be well-served to take a different tack tonight, however. While he's spent his first month in office in a blizzard of activity, issuing executive orders and squelching controversies, there's been little progress with his agenda in Congress.\nTop-line items like tax cuts and healthcare reform will be heavy legislative lifts with a baulky conservative caucus in the House and a narrow Republican majority in the Senate, requiring presidential leadership of a kind not yet demonstrated by Mr Trump.\nRecent opinion polls have shown the president's standing with the public improving after a dismal first few weeks, but any progress can quickly evaporate if his \"man of action\" bravado runs headfirst into congressional obstinance.\nTuesday night's speech is the president's first major opportunity to avoid that outcome.\nHe is expected to set out in greater detail his plans to cut spending and boost the economy as well as offer an \"optimistic vision\" about the \"renewal of the American spirit\", a senior White House official told the BBC.\nAt least one Democrat has said he would refuse to shake Mr Trump's hand before the speech, bucking a longstanding bipartisan tradition in presidential first addresses to Congress.\nRepresentative Eliot Engel, a top New York Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would not shake Mr Trump's hand as he enters the chamber, citing the president's attacks on media and refusal to work with Congress.\nIt will be the first time Mr Engel has not sought a centre aisle seat to shake the president's hand in his 29 years serving in the House.", "summary": "Republicans are lining up against President Donald Trump's proposed budget cuts to the State Department, hours before his address to Congress.", "id": "39123281"}
{"document": "This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume.\nWales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated.\nThis was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters.\nThe bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights.\nAs well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'.\nThere was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships.\nBut Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite.\n\"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long,\" said Coleman.\n\"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that.\"\nWales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed.\nIt is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home.\nWith every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium.\nHe saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him\nThe messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack.\nDespite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making.\nIn the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection.\nHal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu.\nThere was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: \"When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off.\"\nFrom a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players.\nGareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football.\nFor all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success.\nThe vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends.\nEven when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best.\nThese genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football.\nThe death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side.\nCaptain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal.\n\"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today,\" he said. \"He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.\"\nSpeed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of \"There's only one Speedo\" heard at every game.\nA friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not.\nSucceeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud.\nColeman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey.\nAbsent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait.\nThe current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success.\n\"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves,\" he said.\n\"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack.\"\nWales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup.\nPlanning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement.\nJust as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff.\nReturning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.", "summary": "Standing hand-in-hand like theatre actors at their curtain call, Wales' players were met with a spine-tingling rendition of the national anthem from their fans following their European Championship semi-final defeat by Portugal.", "id": "36732018"}
{"document": "Daphne Koller, president of Coursera, said the necessary technology was available but universities had been hesitant about their \"reputation\".\nSo far, online courses have mostly offered certificates for short courses rather than full degrees.\nProf Koller says online degrees can be \"more affordable and accessible\".\nFounded in California four years ago, Coursera has become one of the world's biggest providers of \"massive, open, online courses\" - known as Moocs.\nThe online platform has 20 million students following courses from about 145 prestigious universities and institutions around the world.\nBut most of the online courses have been short units that give students a certificate, rather than a full degree or credits towards a degree.\nProf Koller, speaking at an educational technology conference in London, said the next stage for online learning would be leading universities offering mainstream undergraduate courses online, with invigilated exams and full degrees.\n\"I'm absolutely convinced that will happen - and it will be a lot earlier than 10 years. The societal need is there.\n\"A full-blown undergraduate degree - I'd be surprised if that didn't happen within five years.\n\"Will it be fully online? Or will it have some residential components? That remains to be seen.\"\nProf Koller said the technology had kept improving, but universities had been held back by the \"protection of the brand\" and not wanting to be seen to move away from personal tuition.\n\"It's the perception we need to break, it's not the technology that's been the barrier,\" she said.\nIn terms of supervising exams for distance learners, she said that webcams are \"surprisingly hard to beat\".\nProf Koller said concerns about impersonal online learning were often built on an unrealistic image of traditional campus-based teaching - and that most students are not \"walking on lawns next to ivy-clad buildings\".\n\"It's a false comparison to think it's either anonymous online teaching or else a cosy armchair and individual tutors.\n\"When you have a lecture hall with 300 people, you're not getting personal interaction.\"\nOnline learning should not be compared \"with some utopian ideal of 10 people sitting around in a seminar room engaging deeply with an instructor\".\nProf Koller says that online learning is going to become the route for students who want to improve their qualifications but who cannot afford the time or money to study for a campus-based degree.\n\"Many working adults have obligations, they have a job, a family, a mortgage, they can't go back to school.\"\nIn countries such as India, with ambitious targets to expand higher education, Prof Koller says the authorities will have to use online universities, because there is insufficient capacity in bricks-and-mortar institutions.\nThere are also efforts to use online learning to teach refugees, such as those displaced by Syria's civil war.\nCoursera has announced a partnership with the US State Department to help refugees to access online courses to improve their job chances, such as English language lessons or computer coding.\nIt would remove any costs from studying, such as fees for certificates showing the completion of courses.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\nCoursera was founded four years ago, part of a wave of online university projects that were claimed to be about to revolutionise higher education, making it cheaper and more accessible to students around the world.\nMany millions signed up for free short courses - but Prof Koller is predicting another stage with online learning being incorporated into formal fee-charging degree courses from mainstream universities.\nThere are already many online degrees offered - but Prof Koller says that in the past, such distance learning was seen as something \"respectable universities do not engage in\".\nThere are signs that this change is already beginning to happen.\nThe UK's online university platform, Futurelearn, has announced a project with the University of Leeds, in which course units studied online will count as credits towards an undergraduate degree.\nStudents from this autumn will be able to take course units online and cut the cost of tuition fees for a geography degree.\nPeter Horrocks, chairman of Futurelearn, described this as a \"breakthrough moment\".\nFuturelearn has been created by the Open University, a longstanding provider of degrees by distance learning.\nBut the big change will be if leading, campus-based universities begin to compete for mainstream, undergraduate courses online.\nAnother major US online university network, edX, is launching a project this autumn allowing online course units to be used as building blocks towards a full degree.\nEdX is offering a range of online courses from Arizona State University - and if a student passes eight of these, costing $200 (\u00c2\u00a3150) each, it counts as the equivalent of a first year at university.\nCoursera has launched two online postgraduate courses with the University of Illinois, at a much lower price than their conventional counterparts.\nProf Koller says the past four years has seen a rapid rise in the numbers of students wanting to study online, but a slower reaction from universities in offering fully fledged online courses.\n\"We thought that the change in academic institutions would be more rapid,\" she said. \"Universities are not the most nimble of organisations.\"\nThat change could now be approaching, she says, with universities working out their strategies for a potentially huge market.\nThe hype around Moocs might have faded, but the big impact could be about to begin.", "summary": "Leading universities will offer fully accredited undergraduate courses online within five years, says the co-founder of a US online university network.", "id": "36703778"}

It is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling.\nTrue, football, or soccer as it is known here, is not as central to American as it is to European, African or South and Central American life.

{"document": "A Chinese statement issued during a visit by US Secretary of State John Kerry said the nuclear issue was the \"shared responsibility of all parties\".\nMr Kerry said the two sides must decide \"very quickly\" how to proceed.\nNorth Korea has recently threatened nuclear attacks, and is feared to be preparing a missile launch.\nA flurry of warlike statements from Pyongyang has prompted speculation that a launch could happen on 15 April, when the country marks the 101st birthday of the nation's founder and former leader, Kim Il-sung.\nBy Damian GrammaticasChina correspondent\nAfter weeks of rising tensions, and North Korea's threats of nuclear war, the diplomatic efforts to tackle this crisis are gathering pace.\nThe pledge to work with the US is a clear signal of China's displeasure with North Korea. China is North Korea's only ally, and is not going to stop supporting the North, but wants it to calm things down.\nThe question is will North Korea listen? In recent weeks the North's  regime has made clear it now views having nuclear weapons as vital to its survival.\nIt has said explicitly that it won't bargain them away.\nNorth Korea has reportedly moved at least two Musudan ballistic missiles to its east coast, but on Saturday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted officials in Seoul as saying that no new movement of the mobile launchers had been detected for two days.\nUS officials including Mr Kerry have been playing down a leaked Pentagon report which warned that Pyongyang could have developed the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile.\nSince the UN imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea in February, its leadership has promised to restart a mothballed nuclear reactor, has shut an emergency military hotline to South Korea, and has urged diplomatic staff to leave, saying it cannot guarantee their safety.\nThe North says it has also been angered by joint US-South Korean military exercises.\nThough its rhetoric has been more bellicose than usual, analysts say it fits a long-standing pattern, and may be intended to boost the popularity of Kim Jong-un, who came to power last year.\nIn Beijing Mr Kerry held talks with President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. In comments to Mr Xi, he said the world was facing \"a critical time with some very challenging issues\".\nAmong them were Korean tensions but also \"the challenge of Iran and nuclear weapons, Syria and the Middle East, and economies around the world that are in need of a boost\", he said.\nHe later issued a statement saying the US and China were able \"to underscore our joint commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful manner\".\nHe said the two sides would have \"further discussions to bear down very quickly with great specificity on exactly how we will accomplish this goal\".\nMissile defences in the region\nNorth Korea's missile programme\nThe statement was issued after talks with Yang Jiechi, China's top diplomat.\nMr Yang said China was \"firmly committed to upholding peace and stability and advancing the denuclearisation process\".\n\"To properly address the Korea nuclear issue serves the common interests of all parties. It is also the shared responsibility of all parties,\" he said.\nChina is North Korea's only ally and major trading partner, but has grown increasingly frustrated with its growing belligerence.\nEven so, the BBC's Damian Grammaticas reports from Beijing that persuading China to up the pressure on North Korea will not be easy.\nChina might be frustrated by Pyongyang's behaviour but it is still the North's lifeline, so Beijing is unlikely to cut vital supplies of food and fuel since it feels that may make the North even more desperate and unpredictable, our correspondent adds.\nFollowing meetings in the South Korean capital, Seoul, on Friday, Mr Kerry said no country had a closer relationship with Pyongyang than China.\nNoting that Beijing, like Washington, wanted denuclearisation on the peninsula, he added: \"If that's your policy, you've got to put some teeth into it.\"\nHe warned North Korea against any missile launch, saying it would be a \"provocation and unwanted act\" which would further isolate North Korea and its people who, he said \"are desperate for food, not missile launches\".\nBut he also said the US had tried to tone down its own statements, and cancelled some military exercises.\n\"I think we have lowered our rhetoric significantly and we are attempting to find a way for reasonableness to prevail here,\" he said.\nMr Kerry is on a four-day trip to Asia, and travels to Tokyo on Sunday.\nRussia has also expressed growing concern over North Korea and said on Friday that it had issued \"an urgent appeal\" to Pyongyang  \"to refrain from actions which could lead to further escalation of tension\".\nSome estimates suggest that the missiles North Korea has moved to its east coast could travel 4,000km (2,500 miles), although it is not believed that the Musudan has been tested before.\nThat would put US bases on the Pacific island of Guam within range.", "summary": "China and the US have vowed to work together to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear programme and to settle tensions through dialogue.", "id": "22131316"}

{"document": "Russian state TV has been suggesting - somewhat gleefully - that such products could be banned in retaliation for the EU extending economic sanctions against Russia.\nThe European restrictions were introduced last year after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine; Moscow hit back with counter-sanctions in August, targeting EU producers' profits.\nEven the agriculture minister called the idea of adding a European wine ban 'radical,' given that domestic production is nowhere near enough to meet demand, not to mention the quality.\nBut he didn't exclude it.\nThe bullish tone of the reporting is typical of the defiant mood in Russia after a year under Western sanctions.\nThat same mood dominated the St Petersburg International Economic Forum late last week, dubbed the 'Russian Davos,' where a key message appeared to be: 'they didn't break us.'\nThe glitzy event was boycotted in 2014 by senior US and European executives in protest at the Ukraine crisis. This year some returned to encounter a decidedly upbeat Vladimir Putin informing them that a 'catastrophe' had been averted.\n\"We have stabilised the situation [\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6] and are now making our way forward confidently through this difficult patch,\" Russia's President assured his audience.\nAs well as asset freezes and individual travel bans, the sanctions limit access to Western financial markets for state firms. They also ban arms trade and the export of equipment used in specific oil projects.\nCalculating their precise impact is impossible as the restrictions were imposed at the same time as the price of Russia's chief export, oil, plummeted.\nBut Russia's economy shrank 2% in the first quarter of 2015, the rouble has plunged, inflation has soared and the number of people living below the poverty line has risen.\n\"I don't like it when there is some discrimination, that's not fair,\" Russia's trade minister, Denis Manturov, told the BBC, in response to the news that sanctions were being extended.\nBut he insists it's the oil price that's hurt Russia's economy, not sanctions.\n\"To be honest, for me - who is responsible for Russian industry - [sanctions are] a motivation. To motivate Russian companies to produce and supply not only for the local market, but abroad,\" the minister added.\nImport substitution has become the official mantra as Russia attempts to capitalise on gaps in the market created by Western sanctions and Russian counter-measures.\nSo Mr. Manturov says domestic firms are now supplying energy firms with equipment they once imported, for example, and local dairy production has certainly expanded.\nBut economists warn that the EU ban on credit can't be ignored.\n\"Sanctions are clearly making the situation a lot worse,\" explains Moscow-based analyst Chris Weafer, of Macro Advisory.\nOn paper the ban only applies to state-owned banks, but even non-sanctioned banks and companies are being denied financing by Western institutions wary of the risk.\n\"It's like a voluntary expansion of the sanctions,\" Chris Weafer explains.\nWith no new money entering the market, and no sign of China rushing to fill the funding-gap, Russian banks prioritise credit to major state-owned firms and the cost for everyone else has soared.\nFar from the insistent optimism of the economic forum, the General Motors plant stands almost idle on the industrial outskirts of St. Petersburg. The territory around is filled with unsold cars.\nUS-based GM will shut its plant here for good at the end of June citing a 'challenging economic situation.'\nThe firm was importing most of its car components and the rouble's fall has hit hard, along with plunging demand for vehicles.\n\"Many people don't know what they will do in the future,\" says Trade Unionist Maxim Kulayev, who's negotiating for better compensation for 1,200 workers about to lose their livelihood.\n\"The government says there's no problem, they can all find new job. But it isn't true.\"\nIn fact, other manufacturers are also laying-off workers due to the downturn.\n\"We think the crisis goes on,\" Mr Kulayev says.\nAnd Russia's influential former Finance Minister, Alexei Kudrin, agrees. He estimates that falling oil price and sanctions are equally to blame.\n\"Russia is experiencing serious difficulties as we know. Growth has slowed, living standards have fallen. Of course it's difficult,\" he told the BBC.\nBut he's still not convinced the sanctions can make any difference, politically.\n\"Clearly they were meant to pressure Russia. But I don't think they worked because Putin doesn't respond to that kind of political pressure.\"\nThe EU says its restrictions can be reversed when it sees Russia 'contributing actively and without ambiguities' to solving the Ukraine crisis.\nRussia is engaged in a peace process but continues to insist that Kiev - not Russian-backed rebels - is responsible for violating the ceasefire.\nMeanwhile, it remains officially indifferent to the sanctions.\nSo the St. Petersburg economic forum was trumpeted as a great success, as state TV proclaimed a surge in participants as proof the West's attempt to isolate Moscow has failed.\nThe volume of actual deals done, though, tells a different tale.\nThe total value this year was calculated at $5.4 bn by the forum's executive secretary. That's $2bn less even than last year, when so many of the big players stayed away.", "summary": "Already coping without EU cheese, Russians could soon be braced for life without its wine, fine chocolate and flowers.", "id": "33256382"}

Others managed to crawl out of the rubble.\nBy Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News\nBy nature, earthquakes tend to cluster in space and time.\nAnd Tuesday's tremor in Christchurch is almost certainly related to the much more energetic event that hit the region last September.\nThe critical difference on this occasion is the ground broke almost directly under the country's second city, and at shallow depth, 5km (3 miles) below the surface.\nContrast this with September's magnitude 7 quake: its epicentre occurred some 40km west of the city and at a depth of 10km, and it continued to rupture mainly away from the major built-up areas.\nNew Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.\nThe country straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates: the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates.\nOn South Island, the location of the latest quake, the plates rub past each other horizontally.\nDepth and location key\nThe tremor sent the spire of Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark in the centre of the city, toppling into the square below.\nJohn Gurr, a camera technician, told Reuters news agency the area outside the cathedral was \"like a warzone\".\nPower and telephone lines have been knocked out, while burst pipes have deluged streets with water.\nThe suburbs of Lyttelton and New Brighton are reportedly \"unliveable\".\nQueen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had been \"utterly shocked\" by the news.\n\"My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this dreadful event,\" the statement said.\nThe quake caused some 30m tons of ice to shear away from New Zealand's biggest glacier.\nWitnesses say massive icebergs formed when the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park broke, tossing a nearby lake with huge waves.\nBack in Christchurch, emergency shelters were set up in the city's Hagley Park, a race course and schools as night approached.\nCity Mayor Bob Parker told the BBC: \"This is a terrible, terrible toll on our city.\"\n\"There is no power in most of the city; there is no water in most of the city,\" he added.\nPM John Key said: \"It is just a scene of utter devastation.

In the early 1980s the government dismantled collective farming and again allowed private enterprise.\nThe rate of economic change has not been matched by political reform, with the Communist Party - the world's largest political party - retaining its monopoly on power and maintaining strict control over the people.\nThe authorities still crack down on any signs of opposition and send outspoken dissidents to labour camps.\nNowadays China is one of the world's top exporters and is attracting record amounts of foreign investment. In turn, it is investing billions of dollars abroad.\nThe collapse in international export markets that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2009 initially hit China hard, but its economy was among the first in the world to rebound, quickly returning to growth.\nIn February 2011 it formally overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, though by early 2012 the debt crisis in the eurozone - one of the biggest markets for Chinese goods - was beginning to act as a drag on China's growth.\nAs a member of the World Trade Organisation, China benefits from access to foreign markets. But relations with trading partners have been strained over China's huge trade surplus and the piracy of goods.\nThe former has led to demands for Beijing to raise the value of its currency, the renminbi, which would make Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and possibly hold back exports. Beijing has responded with a gradual easing of restrictions on trading in the currency.\nSome Chinese fear that the rise of private enterprise and the demise of state-run industries carries heavy social costs such as unemployment and instability.\nMoreover, the fast-growing economy has fuelled the demand for energy. China is the largest oil consumer after the US, and the world's biggest producer and consumer of coal. It spends billions of dollars in pursuit of foreign energy supplies. There has been a massive investment in hydro-power, including the $25bn Three Gorges Dam project.\nThe economic disparity between urban China and the rural hinterlands is among the largest in the world. In recent decades many impoverished rural dwellers have flocked to the country's eastern cities, which have enjoyed a construction boom.\nBy the beginning of 2012, city dwellers appeared to outnumber the rural population for the first time, according to official figures.\nSocial discontent manifests itself in protests by farmers and workers. Tens of thousands of people travel to Beijing each year to lodge petitions with the authorities in the hope of finding redress for alleged corruption, land seizures and evictions.\nOther pressing problems include corruption, which affects every level of society, and the growing rate of HIV infection.

But the secessionists viewed it as a defining moment and declared regional elections in September 2015 would be a de facto referendum on independence.\nCatalan nationalist parties won an absolute majority in the 135-seat regional assembly and on 9 November pushed through a motion to start the process towards independence.\nThe Spanish government has hit back, declaring the secessionist step unconstitutional.\nThe votes suggest they have popular support, but last November's non-binding poll was based on relatively low turnout of 2.2 million voters out of a potential 5.4 million.\nAnd the Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) coalition of two major separatist parties which won this year's regional election relied on the support of a radical left-wing party, CUP, to secure its majority in the Catalan parliament. Even then, they fell short of a majority of voters, with 48% support.\nSo the secessionists control the regional parliament but Catalan opinion on secession appears evenly divided.\nAnd with Spain facing a general election on 20 December, and no party expected to win a clear majority nationally, the Catalan issue is only adding to political uncertainty.\nCatalonia - its history, politics and language\nThat is the process that the Catalan parliament has voted to start - with plans for legislation to begin by early December on a separate constitution, treasury and social security system.\nCatalans already have extensive autonomy in education, health and policing. But acting Catalan President Artur Mas wants the rapid creation of other trappings of an independent state, too, such as a diplomatic service, central bank and armed forces.\nBut Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose Popular Party is facing a critical test in December national elections, may invoke article 155 of the constitution that allows the national government to compel an autonomous regional authority to meet its constitutional obligations.\nBefore the 2014 vote, he took the case to the Constitutional Court and the poll was declared illegal. Artur Mas is facing criminal charges as a result. And now Mr Rajoy has returned to the court to have the regional assembly's motion suspended.\nBut there is a growing demand in Madrid for the government to engage with Catalan leaders.\nSo far, the independence movement remains peaceful and organised, in stark contrast, for instance, to the separatist violence which plagued the Spanish Basque Country until recently.\nSpain's rapid return to democracy after the death of dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975 brought devolution for Catalonia, along with Spain's other regions.\nProsperity followed, with Barcelona becoming one of the EU's most high-profile cities, famed for its 1992 Summer Olympics, trade fairs and its football.\nBut Spain's economic crisis hit Catalonia hard, leaving it with 19% unemployment (compared with 21% nationally). The region, which makes up 16% of Spain's population, accounts for almost 19% of Spanish GDP but there is a widespread feeling that the central government takes much more than it gives back.\nThis sense of injustice fuels the independence campaign, especially since Mr Mas was rebuffed by Mr Rajoy when he asked for greater fiscal powers in 2012.\nCatalan became the joint official language along with Spanish after the return to democracy. But in recent years Spain has challenged its status as the first language of instruction in schools.\nIt is difficult to calculate how much more Catalans contribute in taxes to Madrid each year than they get back from investment in services such as schools and hospitals because of Spain's complex system of budget transfers.\nHowever, Spanish government data from 2011, published only this year, show the region paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.5bn (\u00c2\u00a36bn) more than it got back. According to the Catalan government, the discrepancy was closer to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac11.1bn - the equivalent of nearly half of Catalonia's budget for this year.\nMeanwhile, state investment in Catalonia continues to drop: the 2015 draft national budget allocated 9.5% to Catalonia - compared with nearly 16% in 2003.\nWhile some Catalans may accept their tax money being used to help ailing southern regions like Andalusia, there is a perception that their own public services are being underfunded at the same time.\nOn the other hand, Spanish unionists argue that taxpayers in the Madrid region pay out even more.\nScotland's 2014 independence referendum inspired Mr Mas and his supporters, despite the No camp's victory. Unlike Catalans, Scots were allowed a legitimate vote on their future.\nWith its own language, a recorded history of more than 1,000 years as a distinct region, and a population nearly as big as Switzerland's (7.5 million), Catalonia lays a strong claim to nationhood.\nIt also happens to be a vital part of the Spanish state, locked in since the 15th Century, and subjected periodically to repressive campaigns to make it \"more Spanish\".\nAccording to the most recent Catalan government data, nearly one in five adults living in Catalonia today was born in a different part of Spain, while under Franco, the proportion was even higher, at 36.7% (figures for 1970).\nDepending on who you ask, Barcelona today is the capital of Catalonia - or Spain's second city.\nCatalonia profile - Timeline\nCatalonia is worth much more to Spain economically than Scotland is to the UK.\nSo whoever runs Spain after the December general election will want Catalonia to remain part of it.\nBut momentous changes may be afoot in the country's national politics and it is not yet clear who will win.\nThe Popular Party may prefer to stick to the legal route to keep the secessionists in check.\nThe opposition socialists are against independence but have mooted a constitutional reform that would grant the region more powers. The anti-capitalist Podemos movement supports Catalonia's right to a referendum.\nThe rise of new parties also complicates the picture in Catalonia.\nThe centre-right Citizens (Ciudadanos) party, which was born in Catalonia, has become the second force in Catalan politics, winning almost 18% of the vote. Notably, the party is firmly opposed to independence and is surging in the opinion polls nationally too.\nIndependence campaigners argue the idea of a rich region like Catalonia being expelled from the EU is unthinkable.\nIn a BBC interview, Raul Romeva of Together for Yes said that 7.5 million Catalan citizens who were already part of the EU could not be removed from it. However, the region would likely have to apply to become a member from scratch, as it would need to be recognised as a state by all 28 existing members.\nThe EU's executive body, the European Commission, has tried to stay out of the debate, insisting that is not for the Commission to take a position on a member state's constitutional arrangements.\nBut European leaders have backed the stance of the Madrid government.\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron has warned that an independent Catalonia could end up outside the EU and would have to \"take its place at the back of the queue\" if it sought to rejoin. And Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she stands with Mr Rajoy on respecting \"national law\".", "summary": "Pro-independence parties in Spain's richest region, Catalonia, are pushing ahead with a historic plan for an independent state within 18 months, and the national government in Madrid is fighting back.", "id": "29478415"}
{"document": "Across the world, drug laws are being relaxed, from Uruguay to Portugal, Jamaica and the Czech Republic.\nDoes this mean the war on drugs has been lost?\nThe BBC World Service's The Inquiry hears from four expert witnesses, including a former Colombian president and a drugs prosecutor turned defence lawyer.\nAfter many years prosecuting drugs offences as an Assistant US Attorney, growing frustration with the approach inspired Bonny Klapper to become a defence attorney.\n\"About 10 years into my career, it really hit me that the people I was prosecuting were not just drug traffickers. They were mothers, they were fathers, and I really began to take an interest in why these individuals got involved in drug trafficking.\"\nOne Colombian drug runner had a big impact:\n\"At 14 he had a choice: go work in the emerald mines, or do something else.  So he started in the emerald mines, and it was a horrible experience. And then he was offered the chance to work as a driver for one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Cartel. He started as a driver, and ultimately rose up through the ranks.\n\"In countries like Colombia,  sometimes if you want to support your family - and you don't come from a wealthy family or you're not highly educated - drugs is the only path that you have to get yourself out of poverty.\"\nShe noticed other problems back in the US at the other end of the chain:\n\"[We] would prosecute money remitter houses in Queens that were sending drug money to Colombia.  We prosecuted one, we shut it down, and the next day another one opened up in the same location. Or we prosecuted very high level traffickers, either in the US or in Colombia, and once they were extradited, someone else came in to take their place.\n\"We've shifted the problem from Colombia to Mexico. Now all of Central America is inundated because the traffickers got sophisticated, and they're moving through Guatemala and Honduras, and those countries are turning into narco states.\"\nShe argues the approach to drugs users is equally flawed:\n\"The prison system is a disaster. There's virtually no rehabilitation. Locking up low level individuals who have drug problems or who have limited other options is not effective, because they go to jail, they come out, they get involved with drugs again, and they go right back to it.\n\"I have nothing but praise for the law enforcement agents I've worked with [but] so many of them have said to me 'we're fighting a war that can't be won the way we're fighting it'.\n\"The war itself is at a draw. And I believe that draw will be maintained indefinitely unless there's a dramatic change in our approach to drugs and drug trafficking.\"\nFormer Colombian President Cesar Gaviria worked on the Global Commission on Drug Policy report in 2011 which called on states to decriminalise drugs.\n\"Our recommendation is regulation for everything. That's what Portugal did.\n\"If you look at the last 50 years, what has been done? In the US, 600,000 people in jail, $40bn (\u00c2\u00a327bn) of spending a year. The highest rates of consumption of the whole world. You have to say that it doesn't work. It's a failed policy, and public opinion knows that.\n\"Ten years ago it was unthinkable that the US would move massively to the legalisation of cannabis.\n\"That taboo has been broken. In the US, a majority of people are talking about approving legalisation of marijuana.\"\nHe cites the example of Uruguay, the first country to legalise the marijuana trade.\n\"All Latin America's looking at Uruguay. It's a country that also looks how to deal with the production, with the supply of the marijuana that is in the state hands.\n\"I don't expect any major set back of the policy that the Uruguayans have put in place.\n\"From the beginning in 1961, the objective of the UN Conventions has been to live in a world free of drugs, but it's a utopia.  It's something unreachable.  It's not to recognise human nature.\"\nFormer chief scientist in the White House Office of National Drug Policy Control David Murray insists the billions of dollars spent tackling drug traffickers and destroying coca crops were well spent:\n\"A 75% reduction in the productive capacity of Colombian cocaine was achieved by strategic initiatives of supply reduction in partnership with the leadership and political will of the Colombians themselves.\n\"That's been a sustained achievement that then resulted in a more than 45% drop in the prevalence rate of cocaine use in the United States on the streets\n\"This is a global business. As a global business they have their preferred mode of operation where they would like to be with regard to supply routes - ungoverned safe havens where they would like to be to carry out their business with maximum efficiency.\n\"When you push them off of that spot they will adapt but they are diminished.\n\"We may have an idealised world where prevention and treatment and recovery happen in a certain way and we don't have to do the hard and dirty work, but that's not the reality on the ground.\n\"The reality is it's a tough slog, it is a cancer and it is worth fighting. Sure it's discouraging to see drug use continue but it actually is diminished if you take a long perspective over time and we actually are making progress with regard to it.\"\nProfessor Peter Reuter from the school of public policy at the University of Maryland has been a leading academic in the field of drugs policy for decades.\n\"The war on drugs was partly defined by its rhetoric.\n\"The need for national leaders to stand up and talk about the scourge of drugs, and signal to the population that [being tough on drugs] was a priority was an important part of the war itself.\n\"There's going to be less and less of that. I think there's going to be a change both in tone and substance, so the 'war on drugs' will become a less and less plausible metaphor for describing policy. I think it's going to be a public health rhetoric for the foreseeable future.\n\"I do believe that we have in a sense had an experiment with trying to be very aggressive about controlling drugs through use of prohibition.  And we have a sense that that did not work well. And so we're now trying to find better ways of managing the problem, and I think that's welcome.\n\"If you look at the number of people who are in prison for drug offences, at least in the US, that's an important indicator of the change in real policy, and those numbers are starting to go down.  Not dramatically, but they are definitely going down, and many states are making changes that are likely to accelerate that decline.\"\nAs drug laws soften he argues the question of regulation becomes key, as happened when gambling was legalised:\n\"Lottery play was always seen as a bad thing, you legalised it because you wanted to take money away from organised crime, but the result was that the state lotteries became the most aggressive promoters.\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service, Tuesdays from 13:05 GMT\nListen to the programme\nDownload the programme\n\"You have slogans like 'Why be a mug and work when you can play the lottery and win easily?', just the kind of slogan you'd associate with the worst commercial promotion, but done by the state.\n\"Alcohol is still heavily promoted, and it's promoted in states that have state liquor monopolies, and we've only recently really been able to restrict smoking promotions.\n\"So I think there's considerable risk that even if there was a monopoly there would be promotion of marijuana, and clearly what we see in the state of Colorado where it is commercially available, it's regulated, like alcohol, what we see is very aggressive promotion, advertising.\n\"You cannot with a straight face say that marijuana legalisation won't lead to more marijuana dependence.\n\"Choose your problem. There is no solution. Use of psychoactive drugs is a social problem like a whole lot of other social problems. We manage it.

{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nDo you get your business done early, or drag it out until the last minute? What tricks of the trade can an agent use? How do you keep your player happy? What kind of clauses/add-ons go into a contract?\nBBC Sport spoke to David Seligman, an agent at CM Sports in Manchester and an expert in sports law, and renowned agent Eric Hall for some insight into the type of last-ditch negotiations that occur when the transfer window is about to shut.\nSeligman currently represents a number of Football League players while Hall's client list once included the likes of England internationals Dennis Wise, Tim Sherwood and Neil Ruddock.\n\"If it gets to deadline day, you know there isn't any time for the club to go and get somebody else, so the price goes up and you get them the better deal,\" says Seligman.\n\"If you talk to your Harry Redknapps, Alex Fergusons and Terry Venables, they won't wait until deadline day if they fancy a player,\" says Hall. \"Deadline day just gives people like me and the players extra ammunition.\n\"On deadline day, you just go 'chat, chat, chat, chat'. Keep them chatting until you're near to that deadline hour and then they will give you anything, within a certain reason, that you want. Ask for everything because as silly as some stuff may sound, you'll probably get it.\n\"I remember quite a few years ago, I took Kenny Sansom from Arsenal to Jim Smith and Newcastle and I got three times more than I probably should have got.\"\nSeligman adds: \"I negotiated a lower league player's release from his contract at one club in January and we were offered \u00a35,000 to cancel his contract two days before the window closed.\n\"We waited and one hour before the window closed I got him double that. We were playing a game of chicken - we kept saying we wouldn't accept it - and it went down to the wire and the price went up.\"\n\"It's all about assessing who has the power - the club or the player,\" says Seligman. \"I once represented a player who had not scored a goal for a long time but he had played at a high level so, in his head, he wanted to earn a certain amount of money.\n\"I eventually got him \u00a32,500 a week after one club had initially offered \u00a3700 a week. He got a \u00a310,000 signing on fee, too. From my point of view, when I first touted the player to the manager concerned, he was very interested. I gauged that by the fact he rang me back 25 minutes later after he'd done some digging and watched some videos.\n\"He said there and then there would be an email with a contract offer within the hour. At that point, I knew I had the power - he was the club's number one target.\"\n\"When you're dragging it out a little bit, that's where an agent really has to earn his corn,\" says Seligman. \"You have to find the right balance between keeping the player happy and making sure the deal is not lost.\n\"A conversation needs to be had with the player on how far they want to push it, because it's their career. If you get to a point where the player says they don't want to push it too far, then you have to agree and take the deal that's on the table.\n\"This is where a good agent and a bad agent are separated because if you're a good agent, you are able to analyse the situation and use your contacts in the game to see if a club is speaking to other players and get the player to trust you.\n\"You don't want to lose a deal, but you don't want to cave too early.\"\n\"There's no point in being underhand,\" says Seligman. \"You play them off against each other by being honest. If they think another club is interested it can ramp the wages up.\"\nHall recalls: \"I took Tim Sherwood up to Blackburn a few years ago. The same day, I was doing a deal with Derby where Arthur Cox wanted to sign Tim (who was at Norwich at the time).\n\"I was playing games with my lovely mate [then Rovers manager] Kenny Dalglish and I kept him hanging on. You play one against the other. But if you're good at your job, you shouldn't play too many games. You mustn't underestimate chairmen either because most have the money to buy a club because they are good businessmen. They are not idiots.\"\n\"Another trick is to say the deal if off by saying the offer is unacceptable,\" says Seligman. \"Or you can bring a player's family into it and say the player can't justify the travel because he's got a young family, and then the club say they'll put him up in a flat and help out with that. If the club really want the player it is important to not only look after him but his family too.\n\"Conversely, I had a player last summer who was offered 50% more than what he was earning at the time elsewhere but he turned it down because his girlfriend couldn't move. That's just the real world - she couldn't move in her line of work.\"\n\"I had one player who wouldn't take a second year at a club because he thought he would get a bigger move and earn more money elsewhere - on the advice of his wife,\" recalls Seligman. \"He got paid up after six months.\n\"I've had a lot of English lads who are small and they say to me they want to make it in Spain,\" says Seligman. \"'The game is better suited to me in Spain', 'my dad said it'd be better for me in Spain' but I tell them that if they are good enough to play professionally in Spain, they are good enough to play professionally in England.\n\"People don't like being told a few home truths, but as an agent you have to balance it. You're dealing with human beings who are temperamental and footballers can be more temperamental and egotistical than most.\"\n\"It can be useful to use media stories and hype too,\" admits Seligman. \"If a player gets talked about a lot, whether it be on social media or in the press, there is more attention attracted to them.\n\"If you have a player who is spoken about a lot, you have people wanting to watch him. I had a player who was scouted by a Championship club (he eventually signed for another Championship club) because there were just so many people talking about him and they didn't want to miss out. You have to create that 'don't want to miss out' philosophy.\n\"I've put out stories before now saying that my client has been watched by three or four clubs in a higher division because (a) it's true and (b) it raises their profile.\"\n\"I've already told my players to build up their Twitter following over the next few months and when it comes to negotiations, we can get clauses built in there,\" says Seligman.\n\"If you're a player at a club and you're always giving away your boots, shirts and signed stuff, the fans will love you. Becoming a fans' favourite gives you more power, it helps when you're negotiating a new contract.\n\"Also, you can go to a club on a commercial level and say 'Look, I've got 20,000 followers on Twitter and you can put promotions out via my Twitter feed. That can aid the club, and in return I want an extra \u00a3100 a week.' That's a more innovative term in a contract.\n\"If you have two identical players and you're not sure which one to choose but there's one who you can make more money out of commercially, social media is a new way of doing that,\" adds Seligman.\n\"We've seen financial analysts and pundits justifying high transfer fees and wages for Gareth Bale at Real Madrid and David Beckham at LA Galaxy by the amount of shirts they sell. It's that but on a smaller scale. It's all about making more money.\"\n\"I had a player called Richard Duffy, who was on loan at Coventry from Portsmouth,\" says Hall. \"His loan was due to finish about a week before the deadline and then I got a call from Coventry.\n\"They said they wanted to keep my player until the end of the season. I said 'That's great, if Portsmouth agree, but I want three times more for his wages, plus this, that, a car and a little house for him to live with his girlfriend.'\n\"Because it was a couple of days before the window was going to shut, and Coventry were struggling at the time, they came up with it.\"\nSeligman adds: \"A lot of the time, I get my client a relocation fee or expenses. I use a guy who is really good at relocating players. He sources everything like schools, nurseries\u2026 whatever is necessary. Anything which makes a player comfortable should, in theory, make him play better.\"\n\"The things that tend to work well for my clients are to get things like performance bonuses worked into the contract,\" says Seligman. \"You can get a goal bonus - \u00a3100 per goal, \u00a3200 per goal, etc, or 10 goals can earn you \u00a31,000. Clubs prefer that - to do it per five, 10 or 15 goals - but as an agent I'm not a fan of that.\n\"I had a big argument with a chairman at a Conference club once. He proposed my client got a \u00a32,000 bonus if he got 20 goals - \u00a3100 a goal really - but I said I didn't like that because if he scores 19 goals and gets 10 assists you're going to be delighted with him but he won't get his bonus.\n\"His reply was that he'd sort something out but that wasn't good enough - it's all well and good saying that in August, it needs to be in the contract.\"\nHall recalled: \"I remember saying to Terry Venables [on one particular deadline day] that I wanted my player to get \u00a35,000 if he scores a goal.

We're still trying to play nice cricket with our opening batsmen. Other teams come in and they plunder it these days. It has taken a long time to get Alex Hales in, who is powerful, and give him a go. That seems to be the modern game, there is a lot of power involved.\"\n\"We're not sure who should play in the middle order - we dropped Ravi Bopara, who was quite good. The selectors are very nice people - James Whitaker, chairman, Mick Newell of Notts - but they have never played international cricket. I think James has played one Test match. Gus Fraser, who I admire, he hasn't played international cricket for over 10 years and the coach Peter Moores, he has never played anything at all, so if I was batting I don't think I'd be asking him for advice.\n\"I think it's an important factor, it's not belittling them. I don't think you have to be a great player but I do think you have to have played some international cricket, and been around the international scene, been on tour. [Former national selector] Geoff Miller was very good, 34 Tests. He wasn't a great name, but he'd been around lots of tours and I'm sure that helps.\"\n\"The second-string seam bowling. Stuart Broad and James Anderson are very, very good but it's the second string when the pressure on the opposition eases quite alarmingly. They're trying people at the moment like Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, who's got an awful run-up, and it's not there yet. Off-spin, left-arm spin, they don't seem to have one. Moeen Ali's getting a go but Graeme Swann has been a big loss.\n\"Then the batting isn't solid enough. I've always believed in Test cricket you win from a platform of runs on the board. I'm quite aware of the old saying you need bowlers to take 20 wickets to win, but it's very difficult if your batsmen don't make any runs and bowlers are always under pressure.\n\"The best sides make a lot of runs, they're never really in much danger. We have too many low scores, too many difficulties where we're climbing a mountain for batting badly in the first innings. We don't put enough big scores on the board.\"\n\"The umpires feel more comfortable being able to report them in privacy rather than having to call them in a match. The Laws of the game are held by MCC, from Test cricket to school cricket. The ICC decide, just like the PGA Tour in golf, to have localised rules and they have this rule whereby you can bend and straighten your arm 15 degrees, that is a local rule by the ICC and not the Laws of the game. Many of us don't agree with it but we live by it because that's the rules.\n\"I have always believed to bowl the doosra you have to bend and straighten your arm - that's throwing. Now they have legalised throwing up to 15 degrees. You can tell as a cricketer when somebody has a funny action, but the ICC has chosen at international level to have some boffins in a studio with lights and camera and all kinds of mechanics to say he bends and straightens it - which is really a euphemism for throwing - 10 degrees, so he's alright.\"\n\"Last time in England it was pretty close, it should have been 2-2. It will be close again and it depends how we develop by next year.\n\"England are hoping Moeen will improve. He's done alright so far, his batting has shown glimpses, his bowling has shown glimpses but he's got to do a bit more than that. You can't just flit in and out with your batting and bowling to play well at Test level.\n\"If Mitchell Johnson gets injured and can't play, the odds may come towards England, but Ryan Harris is important too. He has had injuries, so they may have to nurse him a bit. At the moment, they're better placed than us, although in sport it can change quickly.\"\n\"It's a problem and we might have missed the boat, it might be too late. It will still be alright while I'm alive but I don't know about 30 or 40 years. There is nothing certain about Test cricket because as much as we love it and we think it's the best test of a cricketer for his character, his courage and his technique, one-day cricket has become so important to people.\n\"We've seen for the first time in England that when it's not Australia it's difficult to sell the seats. Lord's will always sell out because it's the Mecca, people want to go, it's an iconic place. But at Headingley or Southampton we're struggling to sell the seats and that will happen more and more.\"\n\"I've thought for a long time the ticket prices are too high. The people who run the game might find they are going to have to address that in the coming years.\n\"For years, I have advocated that two grown-ups and two youngsters free should be a family ticket to make it more affordable, but next year the best tickets will be over \u00a3100 at Lord's and more than \u00a380 at other places.\n\"For a couple, that's a hundred and plenty, so they might think 'let's go somewhere else that doesn't cost as much'. That will happen more and more.\"\n\"I haven't a clue. I won't have a say in it will I?\n\"Adversity never breaks a good man, it fines him down like gold so he rises up a better man. You should never be afraid of adversity, it's what you do about it that counts. I've had my share. I've had to climb the mountain again.\"\nInterview by BBC Sport's Jamie Lillywhite", "summary": "Legendary former England opening batsman Geoffrey Boycott opposes the view that England do not concentrate enough on one-day cricket, but is not particularly enamoured with the selectors.", "id": "29160114"}
{"document": "\"The documentary for me started with the questions: 'Is this the end of film? Is digital going to replace it? What are we losing if that happens and what are we gaining?,'\" says Keanu Reeves.\nThe actor serves as producer, narrator and interviewer on Side by Side, in which he sets out to examine cinema's transition from film to digital formats.\nIt seems a niche subject, but Reeves and director Chris Kenneally say they were conscious about making the film for a mainstream audience.\n\"We wanted to take something that was quite specialised and share enough information so people could understand what we'd be speaking about,\" Reeves says.\nBut does the average cinema-goer care or notice what format the film they're watching is in?\n\"If you're not an aficionado, probably not, as long as it was working,\" admits Reeves.\n\"If you go and expect to see a Hollywood studio movie and it looked terrible you'd go like, 'what is that?' So I think it could impact in that sense.\n\"But a perfect film print projected is something that is remarkable and unique.\"\nSide By Side makes no assumptions that audiences will know the technical aspects of filmmaking, so spends some time explaining how cameras work, the photochemical process of developing film and how the introduction of digital cameras has led to the progression of editing and special effects.\nAnd helping to explain is a cast that reads like a Who's Who of cinema.\nDirectors Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, David Lynch, James Cameron, Danny Boyle, George Lucas and cinematographers Wally Pfister (Inception, The Dark Knight) and Roger Deakins (Skyfall, True Grit) are all present.\nFemale filmmakers are represented by the likes of legendary editor Anne Coates, who worked on movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Elephant Man and Lena Dunham, one of Hollywood's hottest talents thanks to her TV show Girls.\nReeves conducted a large share of the interviews himself, which not only helped the filmmakers gain such unprecedented access but also made for a series of relaxed, open conversations.\n\"I can't say it didn't help that I've been in the industry for however many years - I was a known quantity in that sense,\" he says.\nIt took around 18 months to round up and interview all the film-makers. Luckily, a large number of contributors attended an annual cinematography festival in Poland.\nHowever others weren't so easy to get. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino are notably absent.\n\"There were people who weren't available or who didn't want to speak,\" he says. \"We got turned down a few times which sucked.\"\nAlthough mainstream Hollywood films have been shot digitally for about the last 12 years, the first digital film to win an Oscar for best cinematography was Slumdog Millionaire in 2009.\nCinematography Oscars followed for Avatar in 2010 and Hugo in 2011 - also shot digitally.\nSome see this as a shift in the attitude towards digital film, which had previously been considered inferior in quality.\nFilming on celluloid is an expensive and time consuming process. Reels of film that each contain about 10 minutes of footage are developed overnight, creating \"dailies\". Viewing them is the first chance a director will get to see the product of his previous day's work.\nIt is only then they discover if they have the right shots or if they have to go back and re-shoot.\nThe advent of video cameras showed not only that film-making could be done at a fraction of the cost, but that you could see the results immediately. It also enabled anyone to effectively become a film-maker.\nThe invention of low price digital cameras further democratised the film-making process.\nHowever, advocates for celluloid include Inception director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister, who maintain digital images will never have the depth or clarity of film, which they insist on using.\nOn the other side, the likes of George Lucas, James Cameron and David Lynch profess their love for digital and swear they'll never go back.\nAnother issue addressed in the documentary is digital film archiving and preservation - where the introduction of new formats every couple of years is proving to be problematic.\nIndeed, Se7en director David Fincher says he has videos from the early days of his career in unplayable formats, as the hardware no longer exists.\nAs a result, when he finishes a film, he now stores the relevant player alongside the rushes in his archive, to ensure he is able to watch them back at a later date.\nAnd even with modern technology, hard drives can fail, leading to the loss of digital content.\nIt is something Reeves admits he had not considered. \"I had no idea about the situation we're in right now where there is no standardised means of archiving digital information.\"\n\"I didn't know anything about how it could all just go away - it was a bit jaw-dropping.\"\nThe irony is that celluloid is the only format that has stood the test of time over the past 100 years and will continue to do so as long as there are projectors to play them on.\nThroughout Side by Side, Reeves maintains his impartiality but with filming complete, he is able to share his thoughts.\n\"Going into the film I was definitely biased to 'what are we losing?'. Film was being held up as the gold standard and digital was this idea of replacing [it],\" he says.\n\"But what I've come to learn is that it's not necessarily replacing it - but that it's something else. And if it is that, then film has a better chance.\n\"I'm still confident that it's going to hang around.\"\nSide By Side is out in cinemas from Friday, 15 February through Axiom Films.", "summary": "Documentary Side by Side looks at the history of film-making and whether the advent of digital technology spells the end of celluloid.", "id": "21457702"}

{"document": "Brazil's Attorney-General, Rodrigo Janot, has asked the Supreme Court to open an investigation into Lula's alleged involvement in the multi-billion dollar scandal that has already seen dozens of lawmakers arrested.\nHere we look at the accusations in more detail and how the once popular ex-leader came to be linked to the allegations.\nAt this stage, few details of the accusations against Lula are known as neither the Attorney-General's office nor the Supreme Court have made them public.\nWhat is certain is they are connected to Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a multi-billion dollar kickback scheme at state-oil company Petrobras.\nInvestigators say that starting in 2003, construction companies formed a cartel to overcharge Petrobras for building contracts.\nThey would then pay part of their windfall to Petrobras executives and politicians who were in on the deal.\nProsecutors allege that the Workers' Party, of which both Lula and current President Dilma Rousseff are members, partly financed its campaigns and expenses through these kickbacks.\nSao Paulo newspaper Folha quoted Attorney-General Janot as saying that the kickback scheme \"could never have functioned for so many years and in such a broad and aggressive form under the federal government without the participation of ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\".\nLula, who governed from 2003 to 2011, has denied the allegations.\nAt this stage, we do not know what the evidence against Lula is. Local media have reported that the Attorney-General has sent several folders of documents to the Supreme Court.\nNor is it known what the exact charges against Lula could be. Newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo reports that Mr Janot would charge Lula with obstruction of justice.\nThe newspaper says that the former leader is suspected of hampering Operation Car Wash, the investigation into corruption at Petrobras.\nAccording to the daily, the Attorney-General will cite President Rousseff's nomination of Lula as her chief of staff as evidence that Lula and Ms Rousseff tried to obstruct justice.\nUnder Brazilian law, members of the cabinet can only be investigated by the country's highest court.\nLula was sworn in as chief of staff in March, but a judge suspended the nomination within an hour, arguing that it was a move to shield Lula from possible prosecution by the federal judge investigating the Petrobras scandal.\nThe country's Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether Lula will be able to take up his post or not.\nThe Attorney-General's move is based on testimony given by Senator Delcidio do Amaral as part of a plea bargain, according to Brazilian media.\nMr Amaral of the governing Workers' Party was arrested in November on charges of obstructing justice, the first sitting senator to be arrested in Brazilian history.\nHe is accused of trying to help former Petrobras executive Nestor Cervero flee the country. Cervero was jailed for being the mastermind of the Petrobras corruption scandal.\nMr Amaral has been collaborating with the authorities.\nHis testimony also prompted the Attorney-General to request the launch of an investigation into former presidential candidate Aecio Neves.\nMr Neves lost to Ms Rousseff in the 2014 presidential race.\nYes, police took the ex-president for questioning on 4 March.\nThe officers escorting Lula to the police station were acting under a judge's order called a \"conducao coercitiva\" (bench warrant) which means that a person is commanded to appear before authorities to give testimony.\nPolice also searched his house in Sao Bernardo, the offices of the Lula Institute - a non-governmental organisation founded by the ex-leader - and the homes of some of his family members and associates.\nIn total, 200 police officers enforced 33 search and 11 arrest warrants at locations in three Brazilian states.\nWhile the allegations were related to the Petrobras kickbacks scheme, they focussed specifically on two properties allegedly owned by Lula's family.\nProsecutors alleged that Lula had received \"illicit benefits\", such as having one of the construction firms involved in the Petrobras scandal renovate a luxury beachfront apartment and a ranch for his family.\nThey said that \"the suspicion is that the improvements and the properties are bribes derived from the illegal gains made by OAS [construction firm] in the Petrobras graft scheme\".\nInvestigators said they also had evidence that in 2014 the ex-president received at least $270,000 (\u00c2\u00a3190,000) worth of furniture and improvements for the beachfront apartment in Guaruja.\nThey said they were also looking into sums paid to Lula by construction firms involved in the scandal as donations or speaking fees.\nLula denied any wrongdoing.\nLula was the political mentor of current President Dilma Rousseff and remains close to Ms Rousseff, who nominated him as her chief of staff in March.\nMs Rousseff is currently facing impeachment proceedings over allegations she manipulated government accounts prior to her re-election in 2014.\nBut up until now, she has not been linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal, even though some of her critics have questioned how she could not have been aware of such a wide-ranging kickback scheme while she held a senior position at the oil giant.\nMs Rousseff chaired the Petrobras board of directors from 2003 to 2010.\nIf her close friend and mentor Lula were to be charged, pressure on the president would increase massively at an already difficult time in her political career,", "summary": "The former president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has been accused of playing a key role in a huge corruption scandal involving state-oil company Petrobras.", "id": "35728124"}
{"document": "The eggs command a high price from farms which produce meat, leather and other goods, so there are plenty of people willing to take on the risky job.\nBut whether this derring-do should be legal or not has become a hot topic in the state of Queensland, where the government is reviewing its crocodile management plan.\nProponents say legalisation in the neighbouring Northern Territory brought substantial economic benefits, particularly to indigenous communities, without affecting crocodile numbers.\nCritics, though, say it is not right to take the eggs, as most are already lost to inundation or predation.\nLeichhardt Federal MP and former crocodile farmer Warren Entsch says few people understand the crocodile industry and \"it's easy to bring emotional claptrap\".\nHe told the BBC he strongly supports legalising egg harvesting in Queensland.\nHe would like to see a quota of eggs taken from nests, harvested, then sold to farmers who supply skins to global fashion houses.\nMr Entsch said the number of saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory had grown substantially despite the provision for egg harvesting, with current estimates putting their population at around 100,000.\n\"Now there are more crocodiles [in the Northern Territory] than before when the 'white fella' came to Australia,\" said Mr Entsch.\n\"The proliferation of the crocodile is huge and that in itself is causing a few problems.\"\nBut conservationists say only a few crocodiles reach maturity in the wild and removing eggs could have a devastating impact.\n\"We're playing God to a degree, there's a reason why their [survival rates] are so low, because only the strongest fittest baby will survive,\" Australia Zoo crocodile research team leader Toby Millyard said.\nThe wild world of crocodile farming\nWarren Entsch said one of the more unusual encounters he had while crocodile farming was during a flight over Queensland in the 1980s.\nHe was forced by the pilot to travel in the cargo bay alongside a bigger-than-expected haul of crocodiles. Three were tied up and covered with hessian bags because Mr Entsch miscalculated the number of transportation cages.\nHe told the BBC he was given a loaded handgun and warned not to shoot the fuel tank if the crocodiles escaped their makeshift restraints.\nThe animals became ill due to altitude sickness, leading them to vomit and defecate throughout the plane. \"They went ballistic,\" Mr Entsch recalled.\nCrocodile farmer John Lever, from Koorana in Queensland, has been on multiple trips to gather eggs from crocodile nests.\nThe 63-year-old said he had some close calls with crocodiles, but \"it's a bit like having a near miss in your car, you go off and forget about it\".\n\"You learn to manage behaviour about the nest, but when a big male challenges you at night and you're on a little boat on the river in the dark that can be pretty intimidating when they're 5m (16ft) and three quarters of a tonne (750kg),\" Mr Lever said.\nThe estuarine crocodile is protected as a vulnerable species under current Queensland legislation, a point of conjecture on both sides of the debate.\nThe state government says it will only back the egg harvesting plan if it does not threaten the animal's survival in the wild.\nMr Millyard said accurate surveys of crocodile populations had not been conducted for a decade and needed to be completed before a decision was made.\n\"Anything people say about crocodile numbers is really hearsay and opinion,\" he said.\nThe final report into a trial live egg collection trial in Cape York - the largest and most intact tropical savanna left on Earth - is expected to be released by the Queensland Government in the coming weeks.\nRobbie Morris, environmental manager of Pormpuraaw Aboriginal Shire Council in Cape York, said the study has shown there would be no impact on populations if a limited harvest of wild eggs are taken from nests that would already be washed away by flooding.\n\"Wild eggs could be taken and hatchlings reared without influencing the population,\" he told the Cairns Post.\n\"If we do actually get the go ahead to do a wild egg harvest there would be scope for three or four permanent positions at the farm for local indigenous people.\"\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation's Andrew Picone said a range of issues needed to be considered before allowing egg harvesting in Cape York.\n\"At face value it presents some problems [but] if there's not any economic opportunities on the Cape [York] things like mining and other extractive industries will continue to be seen as the only option, and undermine tourism,\" Mr Picone told the BBC.\nHe agreed that expanding the farming industry in Queensland could also provide culturally appropriate opportunities for remote indigenous communities.\nMeanwhile, the Northern Territory recently increased the number of eggs that can be harvested each year by 40% to 90,000 viable eggs.\nIts Wildlife Trade Management Plan also allows for the take of 1,000 live crocodiles.\nThe government aims to double its crocodile products industry to A$50m ($35m; \u00c2\u00a324m) in four years.", "summary": "It is the stuff of Boys' Own adventure novels - rugged Australians dropping into wild saltwater crocodile nests to snatch day-old eggs from territorial females.", "id": "35339947"}
{"document": "Derek Penman said the oversight of the project was inadequate and made 30 recommendations.\nJustice Secretary Michael Matheson said the report included some \"hard messages\" for the force and pledged the recommendations would be implemented.\nThe report followed the M9 crash in which Lamara Bell and John Yuill died.\nMs Bell, who was discovered critically injured in the crashed car, had been in the vehicle next to her dead partner Mr Yuill for three days. She died later in hospital.\nPolice Scotland admitted they did not investigate a report they had received about the crash until three days after it happened.\nThe father and grandfather of Ms Bell's five-year-old son Kieran, said the report delivered \"a damning indictment on Police Scotland's call-handling processes\".\nIn a statement, Kieran's father Lee Burt and grandfather James McMillan said \"such a catastrophe should never happen again\", and that Police Scotland were \"guilty of failing communities across Scotland\".\nThey added: \"At the heart of this tragedy is Kieran who never stops speaking about his mum.\n\"Some mornings he will wake up a happy boy because he dreamt of Lamara, but it is heartbreaking when a little boy tells you he misses his mum and the sound of laughter changes to silence.\"\nMs Bell's brother Martin said he was no closer to understanding why the call reporting his sister's vehicle had crashed down an embankment was not investigated.\nHe said he would have to wait for the results of an inquiry by Pirc (Police Investigations and Review Commissioner) to get the answers to those specific questions.\nThe HM Inspectorate of Constabulary report, which concentrates on police call-handling more generally, found examples of call handlers being under pressure to end calls quickly and grading of calls being dependent on resources available.\nMr Penman said staffing levels at Bilston Glen - where the call regarding the M9 crash was received - were insufficient and had resulted in poor call-handling performance, although the force had made \"considerable efforts to address this\".\nThe report also said:\nRead our guide to 10 things we have learned about police call-handling from the report.\nThe report offered assurances on areas including staffing levels, the effective handling of emergency and high priority calls, and training arrangements for new staff.\nIts recommendations included a review of the use of ad hoc \"scribble pads\" by service advisors and to \"provide definitive guidance on their use, issue and proportionate supervision\".\nScribble pads are used by some staff to note information rather than inputting it directly into the computer system.\nMr Penman said there were \"a number of weaknesses\" in Police Scotland's approach to the roll-out of its new national call handling system.\n\"This model is a critical element in the delivery of frontline policing and a key part of the bringing together of Police Scotland post reform,\" he said.\n\"The oversight of this project has been inadequate with key risks and other issues not being identified or highlighted to senior managers.\n\"There was an initial focus on meeting deadlines and increased productivity rather than a well-managed project with a focus on customer service, good staff relations and thorough process design.\"\nMr Penman also said that Police Scotland should focus on stabilising the existing call-handling arrangements before making any further changes.\nPlans to close control rooms in Aberdeen and Inverness have already been postponed and Mr Penman said that should not change in the near future.\nSpeaking in the Scottish Parliament, the justice secretary said independent experts would be brought in to provide strong assurances before any decision was considered regarding the implementation of proposed changes to Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness control centres.\nIn January 2014, Police Scotland announced proposals to cut the number of police control rooms, retaining five of its 11 sites.\nDumfries was first to close, followed by Stirling, Glenrothes, and Pitt Street in Glasgow in March 2015.\nAberdeen, which has two control rooms was scheduled for the end of this year.\nThe reform plan saw Motherwell and Govan becoming a West Area Control centre, Bilston Glen near Edinburgh given responsibility for the East Command Area and Dundee the North Area Command.\nInverness was to lose its police control room but would instead become the new hub for the command and control of major incidents and national events anywhere in the country.\nFollowing the interim HMICS report in September, plans to close Aberdeen and Inverness were put on hold.\nMr Matheson said that, in future, \"any dip in performance such as experienced in Bilston Glen earlier this year will become quickly apparent and will trigger rapid intervention\".\nHe also said unannounced visits would be made to call centres which would begin with immediate effect and would be ongoing until the restructure was complete.\n\"The report also includes some hard messages for Police Scotland and I have been assured that all 30 of the recommendations will be accepted and actioned by them,\" he said.\n\"It is my strong conviction that investment in staff is as important if not more important than investment in systems.\"\nPolice Scotland's Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick said the force would be implementing the recommendations of the report \"through a detailed and comprehensive action plan\".\nShe said maintaining the eight previous systems had not been a \"viable option\" and that the changes required had been \"highly complex\".\n\"We acknowledge there have been challenges.

It looked strikingly modern, it came with none of the partisan baggage of 1980s politics and in an era of bitter industrial disputes that blighted rivals such as the Times, it carved out a large readership.\nAt its peak sales hit around 428,000 copies a day. Twenty-five years later, the number of copies being sold on a weekday in newsagents is rather closer to 28,000.\nThis is an announcement that has been long awaited. The problem about switching to digital is that the big British print newspapers bring in revenues in hundreds of millions of pounds while even the best digital products make only tens of millions.\nThe long decline in print readership has led to many declarations that print will be dead in a few years' time, but until a way is found to make more money out of digital, they will hang on to their print readers to the very end.\nESI said the number of staff affected would be \"confirmed following a consultation period\".\nIt said a \"significant number\" of staff would move to Johnston Press, which also own the Scotsman, the Yorkshire Post and some 250 other local and regional newspapers, as part of the sale of the i newspaper.\nThe closure of the Independent's print editions will have \"no bearing on the status\" of the London Evening Standard - also owned by ESI - the company added.\nThe Independent's editor Amol Rajan tweeted: \"Impossible to over-state how proud I am of the most dedicated, clever, industrious and brave staff in the history of Fleet St.\"\nThe Independent was set up in 1986, and at its peak had a circulation of more than 400,000 copies, but December's figures showed it lagging far behind rival national newspapers.\nRussian billionaire Alexander Lebedev took control of the loss-making newspapers in 2010 when he bought Independent News for Media for \u00c2\u00a31.\nIn 2014, his son Evgeny told the BBC the Independent could be sold if someone \"offers the right price\" - but he was \"not actively trying to sell it\".\nThe first front page of the Independent was written by Mark Urban, now BBC Newsnight's diplomatic correspondent, a 25-year-old \"young stripling\".\n\"I went there because I was inspired\", he said. \"Their mission was to be the best. I thought it was a noble mission, and even if it all goes horribly wrong, it's worth a try.\"\nMany experienced journalists were among those who risked their careers and turned up \"with typewriters\" to launch the title, he said.\n\"For four weeks before launch dates, there were dummy runs every day. There was a very strong sense of purpose.\"\nJournalists from other publications and broadcasters paid tribute to the title and its staff.\nITV political editor Robert Peston tweeted: \"Closure of @Independent as print title is heart-rending, terrible. Such an important paper in its day.\"\nThe BBC's Andrew Marr, a former editor of the Independent, replied: \"Not in its day, Robert. Its day is now!\"\nEditor of the Independent on Sunday Lisa Markwell tweeted some of the paper's most memorable front pages, adding: \"My proudest professional achievement has been to preside over the brilliant, brave @IndyOnSunday team for 3 years.\"\nStephen Glover, a co-founder of the Independent, said the paper was selling \"so few copies that it doesn't really make sense to go on printing it every day\".\nSpeaking on Thursday - before the move was confirmed - he told BBC Newsnight: \"If it is true then I think it will be the first of many papers which stop their print editions and have another existence online.\"\nHe said the Financial Times and the Guardian could also stop producing print editions \"within the next few years\", and in 10 to 15 years there would not be \"very many\" printed newspapers.\nMr Glover said there was a \"longer question\" about whether online-only papers could support the same number of journalists and do the \"same sort of journalism\" as printed ones.\nThe Times' media editor Beth Rigby said the industry had been in turmoil for many years, \"and now we're beginning to see the hard end of that\", adding that the Guardian and Telegraph were also facing major changes.\nWriting in the Guardian's website, professor of journalism Brian Cathcart predicted that all UK national newspapers would eventually go out of print.\nHe added: \"No-one can say in what order it will happen, but it will happen to the most venerable titles, even to the top-selling Sun and Mail.\"", "summary": "The Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers are to cease print editions in March, leaving only an online edition, the owner has said.", "id": "35561145"}
{"document": "The Washington Post demanded impeachment, followed by a Senate trial. Time magazine, deeming it necessary to publish its first-ever editorial, thundered: \"The president should resign.\"\nOutside the White House, protesters waved placards at passing motorists: \"Honk for Impeachment.\" Even Washington's most influential columnist, Stewart Alsop, who was normally supportive of the president, called him an \"ass.\" The president had lost his moral authority, argued his critics, and with it, his ability to govern. The country faced a constitutional crisis. The republic was imperilled.\nSuch was the feverish reaction to the events of 20 October, 1973, a date remembered in the national memory as the \"Saturday Night Massacre\" - a pivotal moment in the unfolding Watergate controversy.\nWith scandal engulfing the White House, Richard Nixon decided to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate \"all offenses arising out of the 1972 election \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 involving the president, the White House staff or presidential appointments\".\nNixon's Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and his Deputy Attorney General, William Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out the president's order. Eventually, the Solicitor General Robert Bork, who was third in command at the justice department, was prepared to fire Cox.\nThe White House announced the news at 8:22pm that Saturday evening.\nYesterday, almost as quickly as the news that he had been sacked as head of the FBI reached James Comey in Los Angeles, these two dramatic episodes were being described as historically analogous.\nThe president had fired the lead figure in an investigation into alleged wrongdoing by members of his own team.\nThe Nixonian parallels were obvious.\nRoger Stone, a Trump associate who also worked in 1972 for the notorious Committee to Re-elect the President, told the New York Times: \"Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling.\"\nThe Nixon presidential library even trolled the White House on Twitter: \"FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian.\"\nDemocrats insinuated that Comey was fired for similar reasons to Cox, because he was closing in on the truth.\nThere were other resemblances, too. In the lead-up to the Saturday Night Massacre, the Nixon White House was still reeling from the resignation of the president's chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, a central figure in the Watergate scandal, just as the Trump administration continues to be buffeted by the swirl of controversy surrounding the forced departure of General Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor.\nThere's the suspicion now, as there was four decades ago, that an embattled White House has something to hide.\nSo is this truly a re-run of the events of 1973? Is the past repeating itself?\nEven by the standards of the Nixon presidency, the autumn of 1973 was unusually chaotic.\nIt saw the resignation of Vice-President Spiro Agnew because of fraud, tax evasion, bribery and extortion allegations.\nThe Middle East was in the grip of the Yom Kippur war, a conflict between US-backed Israel and Arab forces armed by the Soviets that threatened to blow-up into a broader conflagration between Washington and Moscow.\nIn Washington, Nixon was fighting a pitched battle with Archibald Cox and the courts.\nCox, a Harvard professor who had been appointed as special prosecutor in May that year, had issued a subpoena ordering the White House to hand over nine tapes of phone calls and West Wing conversations in connection with the Watergate break-in. Nixon's legal team argued the principle of executive privilege should apply, and the tapes should remain private.\nOn 12 October, however, the Court of Appeals in Washington upheld a lower court's ruling granting Cox's request. Rather than comply, Nixon decided to fire the special prosecutor, something his Attorney General Elliot Richardson had promised Congress would never happen.\nA president stood in defiance of the courts, putting himself above the law of the land. It was a textbook constitutional crisis.\nDonald Trump's sacking of his FBI director, while highly unusual and deeply controversial, is constitutionally permissible. No court orders have been flouted. The president, while breaking with the norm of allowing FBI directors to serve out their ten-year terms unimpeded, is not putting himself above the law.\nTrump's motivations may also be different. Nixon sacked Cox through fear his criminality was about to exposed.\nWithin the FBI, agents believe that Trump sacked Comey primarily out of pique and spite because of his refusal to publicly exonerate Trump against allegations of collusion with the Kremlin, and also because Comey refused to back up Trump's unsubstantiated claims that Barack Obama ordered the wire-tapping of Trump Tower.\nUnlike the Saturday Night Massacre, the president is at one with the most high-ranking figures in the Justice Department rather than at odds with them. The president, the attorney general and the deputy attorney general together they made the case that Comey should go - not purportedly because of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but because of the former director's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\nThe politics is also very different. Back in 1973, the Democrats controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives. That put the investigative machinery of Congress in their hands. Senate hearings were already underway, and the Saturday Night Massacre gave them fresh impetus.\nNixon also faced an acid shower of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and around the country. \"Clearly we face a constitutional crisis,\" lamented the Republican governor of Michigan.\nThere have been Republican critics of Trump's decision to fire Comey. But so far they haven't been so vehement. Crucially, the Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell is resisting demands from the Democrats, and some in his own party, to back calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the 2016 election.\nPolitically, Donald Trump remains strong, because of the support of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill and his grassroots supporters in the American heartland.\nNixon, by contrast, was politically weak. This became apparent only a few days later when the White House indicated it would hand over the tapes, which included a recording of the infamous conversation between the president and Haldeman, eighteen and half minutes of which were missing.\nNixon was also forced to appoint a new special prosecutor. And eventually, of course, the push for impeachment gathered unstoppable momentum, and he was forced to resign as president.\nIn 1973, Democrats were hollering impeachment. In 2017, the party's congressional leadership has not publicly uttered that explosive word.\nWhat maybe similar between now and then is the intemperate mood of the president. As demonstrated by his Twitter tirades, Donald Trump is lashing out publicly against his critics, much as Nixon did privately in his final months in office.\nPolitico is reporting that Trump shouted at the television over the Russian investigation, which again has echoes of Nixon's executive mansion tantrums.\nCuriously, both presidents also saw Florida as a bolt-hole from the pressures of Washington, Nixon opting for Key Biscayne, Trump regularly visiting Mar-A-Lago - although a key difference is that Nixon medicated himself with alcohol, while Trump is famously teetotal.\nBut the Saturday Night Massacre and the Tuesday Night 'You're fired\" are not directly comparable.\nThe sacking of Archibald Cox contributed heavily to Nixon's forced departure from the White House. It was widely seen as an impeachable offence.\nThe removal of James Comey, in and of itself, does not pose such an existential threat to the Trump administration.", "summary": "The New York Times called for the president to leave office immediately, describing it as \"the last great service\" he could perform for the country.", "id": "39875134"}
{"document": "\"I am seriously considering emigrating to Australia, Jamaica or the US,\" says Faye Jones.\nThe 32-year-old PA from Wokingham jumps every time there's a knock at the door and tiptoes around neighbours who might call the police.\nHer crime? Five years ago, Faye was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and after suffering from the side effects of prescribed drugs, she now uses cannabis to ease her pain, nausea and inflammation.\nIn the UK, where cannabis is a Class B drug, police can issue warnings or on-the-spot fines for possession of a small amount, while courts can impose sentences of up to five years for possession of larger amounts and up to 14 years for those who supply or produce it.\nFaye - a campaigner for United Patients Alliance (UPA), which is calling for cannabis to be legally accessed by patients - has a raft of places she could start a new life.\nMedicinal cannabis is legal - or being legalised - in 25 US states, and in countries from Canada to Italy.\n\"But I'd rather not leave the country I was born in,\" she says. \"Mum would be devastated.\"\nPerhaps now she won't have to. A group of MPs has called on the government to legalise medical cannabis after publishing the results of a seven-month inquiry into medicinal use of the drug.\nThe All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Drug Policy Reform took evidence from 623 patients, professionals and experts and more than 20,000 scientific and medical reports were reviewed.\n\"The results are clear. Cannabis has a medical benefit for a wide range of conditions,\" says Mike Barnes, a professor of neurological rehabilitation.\nHowever, the NHS warns that cannabis use carries a number of risks, such as impairing the ability to drive, as well as causing harm to lungs if smoked and harm to mental health, fertility or unborn babies.\nIt can also have other serious consequences, with users potentially vulnerable to developing psychotic illnesses, the Royal College of Psychiatrists says.\nA Home Office spokesman said the government had no plan to legalise cannabis, adding: \"There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health.\"\nYet the End Our Pain campaign, which supports the legalisation of medical cannabis, estimates that one million people across the UK rely on the drug for medical reasons.\nBy Michelle Roberts, health editor, BBC News online\nAfter weighing the evidence, experts say there is a clear therapeutic role for medical cannabis.\nThere is good evidence that it helps alleviate the symptoms of chronic pain, MS and nausea associated with chemotherapy, as well as anxiety.\nBut for treating other conditions, such as depression, headaches and epilepsy, there is limited or no convincing evidence that it works.\nLike any drug, cannabis can cause side effects.\nSmoking cannabis in a joint rolled with tobacco can make asthma worse and probably increases the risk of lung cancer.\nRegular cannabis use puts some people at increased risk of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, and can also reduce fertility.\nCannabis is addictive and you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, difficulty sleeping, sweating and shaking.\nCannabis affects how the brain works. It can make users feel very anxious and even paranoid, it can make it difficult to concentrate and learn.\n37\naverage age of patient\n67%\ntry conventional medicines first\n37% don't tell their doctor\n72% buy street cannabis\n20% grow their own\nThe United Patients Alliance says 30% of cannabis patients surveyed by the APPG cited depression as a reason for self-medication - though patients reported multiple conditions and depression often accompanies other primary conditions.\nAbout a quarter of patients said they used the drug to combat anxiety and a quarter mentioned pain.\nAlmost 70% of the patients surveyed said they had tried conventional medicines first, before turning to cannabis.\nDoctors told Faye she would have to take low dosages of cancer drugs for the rest of her life to deal with her rheumatoid arthritis.\nBut after suffering hair loss, frequent sickness and \"brain fog\", her job became untenable and her boss took her aside.\n\"I'd just bought a house and had a mortgage - I couldn't afford to lose my job,\" she says.\nInspired by MS patients, she tried cannabis and now spends about \u00a3250 a month making her own capsules and creams, mixing cannabis oil and coconut oil.\nFaye says she takes the pills \"like I would ibuprofen, when I need them\", claiming that the low dosage is not enough to make her high.\nAlong with 38% of users surveyed by the APPG, she also uses a vaporiser to consume the drug.\nFewer than a third smoke it with tobacco; one in five smokes it without tobacco. Others eat it, take capsules or use creams.\nMS patient Penny Fitzlyon, from London, said she was prescribed a variety of opiates which \"switched off all interest in the outside world\".\nShe said they left her \"feeling grotty and miserable\", took away her sense of humour and made her constipated.\n\"Then after a second MRI scan, I overheard a nurse saying it wouldn't be long before I'd be in a wheelchair,\" she says. \"So I started doing my own research. Cannabis was the only thing I could find that hadn't killed anyone.\"\nPenny, 52, says she tracked down a herbalist who, unlike street sellers, knew how to mix different strains of cannabis for different patients.\n\"We want to get rid of street dealers,\" she says. \"Backstreet cannabis is not good - they mix it with sand or glass to make it look all sparkly and heavy.\"\nSome 72% of cannabis bought for medicinal use is purchased on the street or from friends, but 20% of users grow their own, in groups or by themselves. The remainder is sourced on the internet or abroad, according to those surveyed by the APPG.\nPenny, who has been cautioned by the police twice, estimates that she spends \u00a35,000 a year on cannabis - a fraction of the \u00a330,000 annual cost of MS prescription drugs, she says.\nThough she avoids \"getting stoned\", without small doses of the drug Penny finds simple tasks such as walking to the shops \"incredibly painful\".\nFor Jon Liebling, from Reading, brushes with the law have only made him more determined to fight for the right to use cannabis as a medicine.\nA traumatic childhood, with a mother who attempted suicide and an absent father, left Jon anxious, depressed and struggling to concentrate at school. But after trying cannabis at university, he didn't look back.\n\"I knew it was illegal\", he says, \"But it just worked. All the pain and stress I'd carried in my back, shoulders and neck for years just went.\"\nBut the 48-year-old's use of cannabis would see him arrested by the police three times - forcing him to leave university, drop out of a nurses' training course and finally land him in court for growing his own.\nThough the arrests led to no more than a slap on the wrist and a fine, he said they left him feeling \"angry and disenfranchised\".\n\"My life has been ruined by the law,\" he says. Now, as political director of the UPA, Jon says the conclusions of the parliamentary group are \"incredibly exciting\".\n\"I don't think judges really want to put people away for it,\" he says. \"I was really honest with the judge about my medical history and he was really sympathetic.\"\nThough Faye fears the police \"taking away her medicine\" or indeed sending her to prison, she says most people are \"very understanding\" - even potential employers.\nShe says she has mentioned her End Our Pain campaigning in numerous job interviews \"and it never stopped me getting a second interview\".\n\"I'm cannabis proud,\" she says.", "summary": "Cannabis should be legalised for medical use, a cross-party group of MPs has said, but there are thousands of people already using the Class B drug for this purpose.", "id": "37318935"}
{"document": "The perception that in some areas police had lost control of the streets was the most important reason disorder spread, they said.\nThe Home Affairs Committee said insufficient numbers of officers were initially deployed and police training for public disorder was inadequate.\nThe Metropolitan Police said it had outlined what it was doing to improve.\nThe Policing Large Scale Disorder: Lessons from the disturbances of August 2011 report said flooding the streets with police was what ultimately quelled the disorder.\n\"If numbers could have been increased more rapidly, it is possible that some of the disturbances could have been avoided,\" it said.\n\"We regret this did not happen and, with the benefit of hindsight, we regard the operation to police the disorder in many towns and cities, and particularly in London as flawed.\"\nIt said the mutual aid system, under which police officers are transferred to forces in need, could have operated more quickly; it may have left areas which had loaned officers to other forces \"vulnerable\".\nThe report said anecdotal evidence from some of those convicted suggested the widespread disorder started when people saw police had \"lost control\" in Tottenham via television and social media. This echoes the findings of the independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel.\n\"Clearly a feeling existed that desirable consumer goods could be made available by looting. There was a substantial element of opportunistic criminality and copycat behaviour,\" the report said.\n\"The absence of a police presence or sight of police officers apparently standing by and allowing criminal behaviour to take place was distressing for those whose homes and businesses were being attacked,\" it added.\nCommittee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: \"Individual police officers acted with great bravery, and we commend them for their actions. However, in London and other areas, in contrast with the effectiveness of police responses in some towns and cities, there was a failure of police tactics.\n\"This situation might have been avoided had police appreciated the magnitude of the task.\n\"We urgently require a rapid improvement in police training to deal with public disorder. We urge the police to act more quickly in future and to review the arrangements for loaning officers from one force to another in this type of scenario.\"\nHe said that, for those who lost their homes and businesses, \"the state effectively ceased to exist - sometimes for hours at a time\".\nMr Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the committee felt that there should have been better communication between the police and the local business community to ensure that people knew what was happening and how best to protect their livelihoods.\n\"Those areas where the chief constables had decided to take pre-emptive action and get police officers on the streets quickly were able to contain this violence much more effectively,\" he added.\nThe MPs say had more officers been deployed different tactics could have been used. The Met Police is training more police to use baton rounds and is considering buying three water cannon.\nMr Vaz said the committee did not feel water cannon would have helped police in the riots and may have caused \"even greater disorders\".\nRiots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest spread across London and to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol over the following days.\nBut the committee's report said the specific causes behind the riots were still unknown.\nThe report criticised the Met Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission over failures in communication with Mr Duggan's family, which it said made a potentially tense situation worse.\nThe committee also concluded it would be unhelpful to switch off social media during times of disorder, following claims rioters used it to organise themselves.\n\"People who made an active decision to join in the disorder could equally well have heard about it on the television as on social media,\" the report said.\nThe MPs say the government needs to urgently clarify whether the police authorities will be able to recover the \u00c2\u00a389.827m it cost to police the riots. It says the riots were an exceptional series of events at a time the authorities were being asked to make savings.\nThey also call on the government to speed up the process of reimbursing people under the Riot Damages Act.\nThe Met Police said it had already recognised and publicised some of its findings on the issues identified and what it was doing to improve.\nA spokesman said: \"This includes acknowledging that we didn't have enough officers available quickly enough to respond to the initial disorder or its subsequent unprecedented escalation. As a result we have changed our mobilisation plans.\"\nHe added that the force was reviewing how it engaged with local communities and was working with Acpo and the IPCC to ensure communication was more effective in future investigations.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers said the report had identified issues it believed was critical to get right within current policing reforms.\n\"This includes the capacity and ability to move sufficient numbers of police officers around the country when required to protect the public from national threats,\" a spokesman said.\n\"We will continue to look at all the various reports into the disorder to examine how the police service can best respond in future to the kind of exceptional criminality seen in August.\"", "summary": "The policing operation to tackle the summer riots across England was flawed, a report from MPs has concluded.", "id": "16237077"}

{"document": "When Google paid $3.2bn (\u00c2\u00a32.1bn) to buy Tony Fadell's start-up Nest in 2014, it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector.\nIt got the man dubbed the \"the iPod's father\" - the engineer/designer who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone.\nNow, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later.\nTellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview.\n\"I've had mine for about two weeks now,\" he says.\n\"I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it.\n\"They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.\"\nWhen Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his \"thoughtful home\" master plan - he hates the term \"internet of things\", which he says does a \"disservice\" to his products.\nBut in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties.\n\"It wasn't handed to me and said, 'Tony clean it up,'\" Mr Fadell clarifies, \"I offered.\"\n\"I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.\"\nThe $1,500 (\u00c2\u00a3965) \"explorer edition\" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house.\nThat was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of \"beta\" status, and that still invites users to \"play\" with preview versions of other products.\nMoreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed.\nBut Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software.\n\"If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,\" he says.\n\"But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do.\n\"Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms.\n\"They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.\"\nFor now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up.\nIt is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam.\nThe motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud.\nIf you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive.\nBut the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired.\nThat means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google.\nBearing in mind, Mr Page told him to \"keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can\", it raises the question: what's taking so long?\n\"Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,\" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling.\n\"I would love to have more, faster.\n\"But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.\"\nHe adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide.\nBut such advances have less impact than a new product.\n\"Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,\" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says.\n\"Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal.\n\"Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.\"\nThe two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements.\nWith the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused.\nJony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly.\nWith the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device.\nJony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like \"a piece of jewellery than a gadget\".\nIn post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters.\nBy contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures.\nThis leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects.\nA question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab.\nBut self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a \"big curiosity\".\n\"I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,\" he says.\n\"How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe?\n\"How does the car exude safety [and be] fashionable as well?\n\"How does this 'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety?\n\"Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.\"\nHe adds that he has \"some thoughts\" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project.\n\"We are having discussion about them all the time,\" he says.\n\"I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.\"\nSo, nothing official yet.\nBut it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties.\nAnd if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future.", "summary": "Is Tony Fadell destined to eclipse his former Apple workmate Sir Jonathan Ive?", "id": "33551340"}
{"document": "Norwegian researchers report that the sea ice is becoming significantly thinner and more vulnerable.\nLast month, the annual thaw of the region's floating ice reached the lowest level since satellite monitoring began, more than 30 years ago.\nIt is thought the scale of the decline may even affect Europe's weather.\nThe melt is set to continue for at least another week - the peak is usually reached in mid-September - while temperatures here remain above freezing.\nThe Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI) is at the forefront of Arctic research and its international director, Kim Holmen, told the BBC that the speed of the melting was faster than expected.\n\"It is a greater change than we could even imagine 20 years ago, even 10 years ago,\" Dr Holmen said.\n\"And it has taken us by surprise and we must adjust our understanding of the system and we must adjust our science and we must adjust our feelings for the nature around us.\"\nThe institute has been deploying its icebreaker, Lance, to research conditions between Svalbard and Greenland - the main route through which ice flows out of the Arctic Ocean.\nDuring a visit to the port, one of the scientists involved, Dr Edmond Hansen, told me he was \"amazed\" at the size and speed of this year's melt.\n\"As a scientist, I know that this is unprecedented in at least as much as 1,500 years. It is truly amazing - it is a huge dramatic change in the system,\" Dr Hansen said.\n\"This is not some short-lived phenomenon - this is an ongoing trend. You lose more and more ice and it is accelerating - you can just look at the graphs, the observations, and you can see what's happening.\"\nI interviewed Dr Hansen while the Lance was docked at Norway's Arctic research station at Ny-Alesund on Svalbard.\nKey data on the ice comes from satellites but also from measurements made by a range of different techniques - a mix of old and new technology harnessed to help answer the key environmental questions of our age.\nThe Norwegians send teams out on to the floating ice to drill holes into it and extract cores to determine the ice's origin.\nAnd since the early 90s they have installed specialist buoys, tethered to the seabed, which use sonar to provide a near-constant stream of data about the ice above.\nAn electro-magnetic device known as an EM-Bird has also been flown, suspended beneath a helicopter, in long sweeps over the ice.\nThe torpedo-shaped instrument gathers data about the difference between the level of the seawater beneath the ice and the surface of the ice itself.\nBy flying transects over the ice, a picture of its thickness emerges. The latest data is still being processed but one of the institute's sea ice specialists, Dr Sebastian Gerland, said that though conditions vary year by year a pattern is clear.\n\"In the region where we work we can see a general trend to thinner ice - in the Fram Strait and at some coastal stations.\"\nWhere the ice vanishes entirely, the surface loses its usual highly reflective whiteness - which sends most solar radiation back into space - and is replaced by darker waters instead which absorb more heat.\nAccording to Dr Gerland, additional warming can take place even if ice remains in a far thinner state.\n\"It means there is more light penetrating through the ice - that depends to a high degree on the snow cover but once it has melted the light can get through,\" Dr Gerland said.\n\"If the ice is thinner there is more light penetrating and that light can heat the water.\"\nThe most cautious forecasts say that the Arctic might become ice-free in the summer by the 2080s or 2090s. But recently many estimates for that scenario have been brought forward.\nEarly research investigating the implications suggests that a massive reduction in sea ice is likely to have an impact on the path of the jet stream, the high-altitude wind that guides weather systems, including storms.\nThe course and speed of the jet stream is governed by the difference in temperature between the Tropics and the Arctic, so a change on the scale being observed now could be felt across Europe and beyond.\nKim Holmen of the NPI explained how the connection might work.\n\"When the Arctic is ice free, it is not white any more and it will absorb more sunlight and that change will influence wind systems and where the precipitation comes.\n\"For northern Europe it could mean much more precipitation, while southern Europe will become drier so there are large scale shifts across the entire continent.\"\nThat assessment is mirrored by work at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, based in the British town of Reading.\nThe centre's director-general, Alan Thorpe, said the link between the Arctic melt and European weather was complicated but it is now the subject of research.\n\"Where Arctic sea ice is reducing in summer - and if we have warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the north-west Atlantic - these twin factors together lead to storms being steered over the UK in summer which is not the normal situation and leads to our poorer summers.\"\nBut the research is in its earliest stages. For science, the Arctic itself is hard to decipher. The effects of its rapid melt are even tougher.\nYou can see David's coverage from the Arctic on BBC News on Friday - on television, on radio and online.

{"document": "He was rattling across the arid wastes of the Baluch desert in Pakistan on Saturday morning in that most Afghan of cars - a battered white Toyota Corrola - when the missile, fired from a US drone, struck his vehicle.\nAll that was left was a charred and twisted wreck beside the desert highway.\nUS President Barack Obama described his death as an \"important milestone\", but disentangling what it actually marks is not straightforward.\nThe most obvious question is what it will mean for the Taliban.\nThe Pentagon said it had targeted Mansour because he had become \"an obstacle to peace and reconciliation\".\nBut it isn't clear that the new leader will be any more open towards the peace process.\nMawlawi Hibatullah Akhunzada was Mullah Mansour's former deputy, and the official line from the Taliban is that his approach is going to be very similar.\nWhat's more, his appointment doesn't rule out the possibility of a battle for succession.\nMansour struggled to contain the splintering of the movement into a series of factions that followed the death of Mullah Omar, the founder of the Taliban.\nThat would increase instability in Afghanistan, fuelling local conflicts and entrenching the insurgency.\nTaliban leader Mullah Mansour killed, Afghans confirm\nAfghan Taliban announce successor to Mullah Mansour\nMullah Mansour's battle to be leader\nWho are the Taliban?\nProfile: Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour\nThen, there is the question of what it means for US relations with Pakistan, which are regarded as crucial to the effort to fight global terrorism.\nThe drone attack suggests the US has lost patience with the Pakistani authorities, which have failed to bring the Taliban to the table, while allegedly harbouring the movement's leaders.\nSo the killing of Mullah Mansour may actually set back the efforts to negotiate a peace settlement.\nOn Monday, the US ambassador was summoned to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry to be harangued about what it described as a \"violation of Pakistan's sovereignty\".\nThe official Pakistani line is that the attack will be an obstacle to future talks.\nThe third question is the one most likely to affect those outside the region: the impact on the drugs trade.\nIt would be tempting to conclude that removing Mansour will make the battle to eradicate opium more straightforward.\nMansour helped oversee the transformation of the Taliban from a movement of pious fanatics, largely funded by true believers from abroad, into something very different.\nAfter the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, remittances from the Gulf fell away.\nThe Taliban needed new sources of finance.\nMullah Mansour is thought to have developed a huge new source of income for the Taliban - along the way enriching himself and his fellow tribesmen.\nThe movement he officially took over last year had been refashioned into what is, in effect, a multi-billion dollar drugs cartel.\nAfghanistan has now completely eclipsed the former hub of world opium production, the so-called Golden Triangle between Myanmar, Laos and Thailand.\nBut whether the death of Mansour will reduce Afghanistan's opium production is a moot point.\nHelmand is a Taliban stronghold and traditionally accounts for around half of Afghan opium output.\nA senior official admitted to the BBC that the intense conflict in the province meant there had been virtually no eradication effort at all this season.\nNevertheless, there is evidence that some farmers are moving away from poppy and back to less profitable food crops.\nOne reason may be the effects of a mysterious blight that badly affected last year's poppy harvest.\nTake a look at the changing patterns of cultivation in these desert areas of Helmand. These images are taken from a forthcoming AREU Watching Brief: Moving with the times: How opium poppy cultivation had adapted to the changing environment in Afghanistan.\nAt the same time, there is considerable evidence that poppy production has increased in areas that are - nominally at least - controlled by the government.\nLast week, I visited an agricultural community just half an hour away from Mazar-e-Sharif in the north of Afghanistan.\nThe city is, by Afghan standards, a model of good governance and has never been a stronghold of the Taliban, yet I found poppy being grown openly.\nConversations with locals suggest that poppy production is not just tolerated, but is actively supported and protected by local police and government officials in return for kickbacks.\n\"Of course the authorities know we are growing poppies,\" a farmer called Taza Meer told me.\n\"They can see we are growing it, but they've got to keep quiet about it. The economy here is weak, people have no money.\n\"The authorities know poppy is the only way people here can make decent money, and they know that people would be very angry if they stopped them.\"\nHe said if the government came in and destroyed his crop or that of other farmers, they would \"take to the mountains\".\n\"The people will take up arms,\" he told me. \"They'll have no choice but to rebel and there will be chaos here.\"\nExperts on opium cultivation say this is a pattern repeated across the country.\nThey say opium cultivation is a sign of the weakness of the government.\nIt occurs when local authorities have no choice but to come to an accommodation with farmers.\nOn that basis, there has been a steady deterioration of central authority, as this chart illustrates.\nIt is striking that more opium was produced in 2014, the last year of the Nato combat mission, than in any other year since the UN started keeping records in 2002.\nMansour may be dead - but, in the absence of other successful businesses, the opium trade has become an increasingly important enterprise in areas the government controls as well as Taliban-controlled areas.\nWhat that suggests is that, whoever is leader of the Taliban, Afghanistan is likely to continue to be the world centre of opium production.\nIndeed, this year, Afghanistan is expected to produce more opium - and therefore heroin - than the world consumes.\nIt isn't hard to work out what that means: more and cheaper heroin coming to a street near you.", "summary": "Mullah Mansour, Afghan Taliban leader and the commander of a militia of thousands of men, died a lonely death.", "id": "36370553"}
{"document": "Released by Norwich City as a schoolboy, he entered semi-professional football, turning out for King's Lynn and Staines Town, who play in the Ryman Premier Division.\nIt was there, in the foothills of the English game, that he looked west and decided to move to the United States.\nDwyer signed up to a firm who - for a fee - help organise soccer scholarships at US colleges for young, talented British footballers.\nGetting a scholarship means the college pays some, or all, of the student's tuition fees and costs.\nThe firm, Soccer Icon USA, held a trial at QPR's training ground, to see whether those who had signed up were good enough for college soccer.\n\"I think I scored a hat-trick in the first 10 minutes,\" remembers Dwyer, now 25.\n\"The coaches took me off early and said: 'So - whereabouts in America do you want to go?'\"\nDwyer spent two years at Tyler Junior College in Texas, before moving to the University of South Florida.\nWhile there, he was signed by Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City. He has since scored more than 30 MLS goals, was named in the 2014 All Star team alongside Thierry Henry and, in 2015, is on a guaranteed salary of more than \u00a3300,000 a year.\nHe is also married to Sydney Leroux, who was a member of the USA's World Cup-winning women's team earlier this year.\n\"It's pretty amazing,\" says Dwyer. \"I'm a little kid from England, and last year I was at the White House [after winning the 2013 MLS Cup].\n\"I just thought: 'What are they doing, letting me in here?'\"\nDwyer is not the only British player who has gone from US college to the MLS.\nMatt Watson - who studied at the University of Maryland, after being released by Wolves as a youngster - plays for Chicago Fire.\nOtis Earle, son of former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle, is at FC Dallas, via the University of California, Riverside.\nPreston-born Luke Mulholland, who studied in North Carolina, is at Real Salt Lake, while Andy Rose, once a Bristol City youth, went from the University of California in Los Angeles to Seattle Sounders.\nFew Britons will emulate their careers. But more and more are trying.\nAccording to the Fulbright Commission, almost 11,000 British students were at American colleges in the past academic year - an increase of 21% in the past 10 years.\nAlthough the number of soccer scholarships is not recorded (there's no American equivalent of Ucas, the organisation through which applications are processed in England and Wales) it is clear they are becoming more popular.\nChris Cousins, who runs Sports Recruiting USA, went to Illinois on a soccer scholarship in 2003.\n\"I was probably one of a dozen going to America, if that,\" he says.\nNow, he estimates that more than 600 British students - male and female - will cross the Atlantic to start soccer scholarships this year.\nCousins thinks rising tuition fees in England is one factor, having increased from \u00a31,100 in 2003 to a maximum of \u00a39,000 a year now. He also thinks social media has played a part.\n\"When you see your mate on Twitter or Facebook playing in California or Florida, it makes it more tempting,\" said Cousins.\nCollege soccer is certainly attractive: in 2013, more than 30 teams had average attendances of more than 1,000, 10 with more than a 2,000 average, with some derbies attracting over 10,000 fans. To put that in perspective, last season English League Two sides Morecambe and Accrington both averaged less than 2,000.\nThe biggest games are shown on national television, and there is a clear route to turning pro: every year, MLS clubs take their pick of the best college players via the superdraft.\nBut there is another reason why more Britons are heading to American colleges - the rise in companies, or middlemen, who arrange soccer scholarships.\nPass4Soccer, which began in 2003, was one of the first. According to their latest annual report, they now have 40 competitors.\n\"It seems in the past 12 years they've sprung up left, right, and centre,\" said Daniel Gray, a director at the company.\n\"Five years ago, there were 10 or 15. Now there are 40. People are jumping on the bandwagon.\"\nEach firm is different but, broadly, the model is the same. Students pay a fee, and the company gets them a place at a US college - if they are good enough on the pitch and are capable of getting a degree.\nThe companies' fees vary. Sports Recruiting USA, one of the cheapest, charges \u00a3999; Pass4Soccer is \u00a31,295; others charge more than \u00a32,000.\nThe firms claim it is money well spent - they say, with contacts and experience, they are able to get better scholarships for their students.\nPass4Soccer, for example, estimate that 15% of their students get full scholarships - meaning the college pays all of the student's fees and living costs.\nSports Recruiting USA say their students, on average, get 90% scholarships - leaving students to pay just 10%.\nWhen a year at a US college costs the average international student more than \u00a320,000, paying \u00a31,000 or \u00a32,000 to a firm could be a wise investment.\nBut, as one QPR player knows, not everyone needs a middleman.\nWhen Tyler Blackwood was 18, he had - in his own words - \"given up\".\nAs a schoolboy, Tottenham Hotspur said he was too short. Watford said the same, as did Northampton Town.\nAfter a growth spurt, Blackwood, who is now over 6ft, was invited to a trial game at lower-league Barnet.\nBut, on the day of the game, the manager Paul Fairclough resigned and his trial never happened. Instead, he began working in his dad's bar in Oakwood, north London.\n\"It was a horrible year,\" remembers Blackwood. \"I had friends in the pro game, and I was watching them make their debuts.\n\"Football had always been my plan, then suddenly I realised - it's not going to happen.\"\nWhen his dad encouraged him to kickstart his career at an American college, they paid for a firm to arrange a scholarship.\n\"But the offers were from bad schools in terrible states,\" says Blackwood. \"In the end, I got my money back and did it myself.\"\nIn 2011, the family went on holiday to Florida, so Blackwood emailed the soccer coach at the University of Tampa, asking for a trial.\nThe college accepted him, but offered only a 25% scholarship.\n\"My dad borrowed money, took out loans, to make sure he could pay the rest,\" says Blackwood, now 24.\n\"I told him he'd only have to pay for the first year, and then I'd get a full scholarship. And I did.\"\nThis summer, Blackwood returned to England for a trial at QPR. It was successful, and he made his debut in August, away to Yeovil in the League Cup.\nHe is completing his four-year degree in London, taking his laptop on the team bus to catch up with work.\n\"I recently had an exam that started at 8pm, Florida time,\" says Blackwood.\n\"That was 1am in the UK. I'm looking forward to graduating, put it that way.\"\nAs Blackwood shows, the quality of British players heading to America, as well as the quantity, is increasing.\nCousins says that, 10 years ago, it was \"county players getting the best scholarships - now it's people getting released from Chelsea and Manchester City\".\nBut what do British players offer that Americans - or other nationalities - do not?\n\"Work ethic sets them apart,\" says Steve Clements, who coached Dom Dwyer at Tyler Junior College in Texas.\n\"I must have had 100 British players, and they've always been hard-working. For example, nobody outworked Dom.\n\"Fantastic player, fantastic person, and a good friend. At Christmas, I came into my office and there he was, on a surprise visit.\n\"He didn't even tell me he was coming. He's that sort of guy.\"\nAnd, says Clements, the British bring something else to the team, as well as hard work.\n\"The Brits have fantastic humour. They're sarcastic, you know? And they can play.\"\nFor those who do not make it professionally, the college degree is a decent consolation.\nGraduates from soccer scholarships move into a range of careers: one of Clements's former British students works for Bank of America, another supplies souvenirs to major league sports (\"If you need a number one finger, I know who to call,\" he says).\nJoe Prince-Wright went on a soccer scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh and came back with two degrees: one in communication, and one in English writing.\nThose qualifications helped him become a website editor for the American network, NBC, in London.\n\"Academically, college was an eye-opener,\" he says.\n\"You only focus on your main subject in the last two years, so I was doing algebra classes, astronomy classes, everything.\n\"We'd have classes, train for three hours a day, then have more classes. On a Friday you might fly three hours to Tampa, and have a game there.\n\"On a Saturday, you'd fly four hours to Chicago, train, play on the Sunday, fly back, then start another week of classes.\n\"It was like being a full-time student and a professional soccer player.\"\nOne man who values a college education is Dwyer, who turned professional before finishing his degree in communications and psychology.\nHowever, despite his fame and fortune, he plans to complete his course, graduate, and finish the adventure he started six years ago.", "summary": "Six years ago, Dom Dwyer's career was going nowhere.", "id": "34097904"}
{"document": "The Social Mobility Commission warns of many \"treadmill families running harder and harder but standing still\".\nIt points to an unfair education system, a two-tier labour market, a regionally imbalanced economy and unaffordable housing.\nPrime Minister Theresa May has promised to tackle social inequalities.\nThe commission's State of the Nation 2016 report, laid before Parliament on Wednesday,  says young families now can no longer expect to do as well as their parents' generation.\nIt highlights that home ownership is in sharp decline, particularly among young people.\nThe commission urges the government to commit to building three million homes over the next decade and to expand the sale of public sector land for new homes.\nIt should also allow targeted housebuilding on green-belt land and modify the starter home initiative to focus on households with average incomes.\nAlan Milburn paints a depressingly familiar picture of a \"them and us\" Britain divided along the fault-lines of wealth and opportunity.\nBut the conclusion of his report - most families are now doing worse than their parents' generation - is staggering.\nIt means social mobility is going backwards not forwards, despite successive attempts to tackle it.\nPhrases such as: \"Huge swathes of Britain feel left behind,\" and: \"The chickens have now come home to roost,\" pepper the report.\n\"So many families are struggling to get by, let alone get up,\" Mr Milburn said.\nHe highlights that of the 65 parts of the country identified by his commission as \"social mobility coldspots\", only three voted to remain in the EU.\nMr Milburn, himself immersed in issues surrounding the social mobility conundrum for six years, clearly feels the country's mood is now becoming dangerous.\nAnd with a nod to 1930s Europe, he told reporters:  \"We know from the history of our own continent, when people feel they are losing out unfairly, the mood can turn ugly.\"\nThe commission notes that a child living in one of England's most disadvantaged areas is 27 times more likely to go to an inadequate school than a child in the most advantaged areas.\nAnd young people from low-income homes are one-third more likely to drop out of education than better-off classmates with similar GCSEs.\nThe report says the government should have \"as its core objective\" the narrowing within the next decade of the GCSE attainment gap between poorer children and their better-off classmates by two-thirds.\nIt also urges the government to rethink its plans for more grammar schools and more academies.\nThe report says grammars are \"at best, a distraction, and, at worst, a risk to efforts aimed at narrowing the significant social and geographical divides that bedevil England's school system\".\nThe report notes a growing gap between the generations, warning that those born in the 1980s are the first post-war cohort not to start their working lives on higher salaries than their immediate predecessors.\nIt says the government must work with large employers, local councils and Local Enterprise Partnerships to bring high-quality job opportunities - backed by financial incentives - to Britain's social mobility \"coldspots\".\nThe report also calls for an end to unpaid internships, arguing that work placements lasting more than four weeks should be paid at the minimum wage.\nThe commission says the problem is not just social, but also geographical, with a widening divide between the big cities - particularly London - and the many towns and counties being \"left behind economically and hollowed-out socially\".\nIt says that in London, the number of top-end occupational jobs has increased by 700,000 in the past 10 years compared with just under 56,000 in the north-east of England.\nThe report warns: \"The growing sense that we have become an us and them society - where a few unfairly hoard wealth and power - is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a society.\n\"The EU referendum in June this year exposed deep divides that go well beyond the box that people crossed.\n\"Public concern -

{"document": "If you were sold PPI via your credit card then the differences can amount to thousands of pounds.\nThis is because of the way some credit card providers interpret the regulatory guidelines.\n\"It's becoming a bit of a lottery,\" personal finance expert Jonquil Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Moneybox programme.\n\"The amount of redress you get depends on which provider you happen to have your credit card with,\" said Ms Lowe, who is a lecturer in personal finance at the Open University.\nThese differences emerged last year when Martin Baker, managing director of the Swindon-based claims management company Renaissance Easy Claim, began challenging redress offers from MBNA, an American-based credit card provider whose cards are extensively marketed in the UK.\nMr Baker noticed that MBNA's compensation offers to his clients appeared to be significantly lower than he would have expected from the high street banks.\nOne client, Mark Pascoe, was offered \u00a35,800 in compensation by MBNA. Had his card been with a high street bank, Mr Baker estimates he would have received more than \u00a313,000.\nMr Baker now has around 1,000 MBNA compensation clients on his books.\n\"In a sample of our cases,\" Mr Baker told the BBC's Moneybox programme, \"we found 80% were due more if MBNA paid according to the way the high street banks pay.\"\nOn average, MBNA's redress offers amount to around half what high street banks would award on the same credit card history, he said.\nCapital One, another American credit card provider, \"adopts a very similar approach to MBNA, with similar results,\" said Mr Baker.\nSo how do such differences arise?\nWhen compensating for mis-sold PPI, regulators require card providers to put customers back into the financial position they would have been in if they had never had PPI at all.\nEach card provider is free to establish its own methodology for calculating redress, within overall regulatory guidelines.\nA key difference arises when a cardholder occasionally pays off their monthly card balance in full.\nTo calculate the compensation owing, banks have to reconstruct a customer's credit card history, removing mis-sold PPI premiums, fees and charges that premiums triggered - for exceeding a card's credit limit, for example - and any interest charged on those payments.\nWith these PPI charges removed the monthly amounts owing are lower. So when card-holders pay off what was their original monthly balance - they have overpaid according to their reconstructed card history.\nThe differing treatment of such overpayments is a major cause of the differences in compensation offers, argues Martin Baker.\nWhile high street banks treat an overpayment as a temporary credit to be set against future spending on a customer's card - MBNA and Capital One treat it as a permanent loan from the customer to themselves lasting for the lifetime of the card, he says.\nIt may sound a technicality, but it can have a significant impact on compensation.\nBecause while regulators require card providers to pay customers 8% interest on such loans, that's far less than the amount MBNA and Capital One charge customers on their card borrowings.\nMartin Baker describes this as a \"systemic flaw\" in MBNA and Capital One's methodology.\nEarlier this year, the BBC asked regulators if they thought MBNA and Capital One's methodologies fell within the official rules and guidelines.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority told the BBC they did not accept that there was \"a systemic flaw\" in the calculations.\nThe Financial Ombudsman said in the cases they were seeing, \"card providers were fairly compensating consumers, taking into account the FCA's guidance and the Ombudsman's approach\".\nTo work out how two such very different compensation methodologies could both seemingly be deemed acceptable by regulators, Moneybox commissioned an independent review of MBNA's calculations from the Open University's Jonquil Lowe.\nAfter a detailed analysis of MBNA's methodology Ms Lowe found it differed substantially from the regulatory guidance most banks follow. How much difference that makes to compensation, she says, will vary from case to case.\nMs Lowe says regulatory guidelines do allow banks to make assumptions about what customers might have done had they not had PPI on their credit cards which include assumptions about how banks treat overpayments in their card reconstructions.\nBut because these assumptions can have so big an impact on compensation over time, Ms Lowe says they need careful monitoring.\n\"If an alternative method is used, it has to be appropriate and fair, given the individual circumstances of the case.\n\"The onus has to be on MBNA to say why its method is fairer and more appropriate than the method set out by the regulator and used, in most cases, by the Ombudsman.\"\nBoth MBNA and Capital One declined to be interviewed by the BBC, or to say why they claim the assumptions in their calculations are appropriate.\nIn a statement, MBNA said its calculations were developed in line with the FCA's guidance, and based on how the Financial Ombudsman would expect them to look at individual cases.\nOf Jonquil Lowe's conclusions it said: \"Jonquil Lowe's report sets out how she assumes the FOS might deal with MBNA's cases, based on her theoretical interpretation of general guidance. Our aim is to put customers back in the situation they would have been in, had they not taken a PPI product.\"\nCapital One said it assessed every case on its individual circumstances and is in frequent contact with the Financial Ombudsman Service to ensure its calculations were \"fair and accurate\".\nMeanwhile, regulators continue to stress that any customer who is unhappy with a redress offer can always appeal to the Financial Ombudsman for a ruling.\nGiven the complexity of the calculations behind the offers, however, Jonquil Lowe doubts the practicality of that advice.\n\"It took me 80 hours to unravel what was going on [and] I've got a lot of technical expertise.\n\"The average consumer could not, I think, reconstruct their accounts in the way that I have done. Not least because the information they get along with their redress is usually not detailed enough for them to be able to make that kind of check.\n\"It is extremely hard for consumers to know whether they had a fair redress, or not.\"\nWith that in mind, Andrew Tyrie MP, the newly re-elected Chair of the influential House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said: \"We'll actually be keeping a very close eye on this in the weeks and months ahead.\n\"We've been working very hard to get a decent level of address on PPI for a long time and we're certainly not going to let go of the subject until we're satisfied a correct and decent amount of compensation is being paid.\"", "summary": "People who were mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) can receive widely differing compensation, a BBC investigation has found.", "id": "33567564"}
{"document": "For decades, large numbers of Haitians have migrated - many of them without papers - to the Dominican Republic, to escape the poverty and lack of employment in their homeland.\nIn 2013, the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled that children born there to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality.\nAn 18-month period followed in which undocumented migrants were asked to \"regulate their status\".\nThousands who did not meet the deadline left the Dominican Republic, with many saying they were forced out by the authorities.\nAs the BBC's Will Grant found, the Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticised for promoting what activists describe as a policy of division.\nWeekly Mass at Parc Cadeau is a simple affair.\nThe church is a small hut made of wicker and palm, the congregation spread out over a few wooden benches.\nLooking around the camp, one of several along Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic, you might think that the parishioners have little to be thankful for.\nIt is surely one of the poorest places in Latin America.\nA year ago thousands of returning Haitians arrived at Parc Cadeau.\nSome had been forcibly deported from the Dominican Republic, others left voluntarily to avoid confrontation with the authorities.\nToday hundreds of families remain on the dusty ranch, living in hastily erected shacks of plastic sheeting, cardboard and rope, trapped in near stateless limbo.\nSoinicier Giles is typical of many in the camp.\nHe spent 22 years living as a farmer in the Dominican Republic, before being deported last year.\nHe takes me to a ramshackle hut to meet his wife Eleny and six of their eight children. The other two were left behind when he was deported.\nThe conditions are extremely harsh, especially for the youngest. \"We sleep directly on the floor and it gets wet inside when it rains,\" Eleny explains.\nThe children were all born in the Dominican Republic itself.\nThey are showing signs of malnutrition and have developed a skin condition since arriving at the camp.\n\"They're very hungry, we all are, because we can only afford one meal a day,\" she says in Creole-accented Spanish.\nOne of the few local figures helping the returnees is the parish priest, Father Luc Leandre.\nWith funds from the International Organisation for Migration, he has helped relocate some of the most desperate families to nearby communities in Haiti.\n\"It's a grave crisis, very, very bad,\" Father Leandre tells me.\n\"The Church is like a mother for everyone and I have a duty to help. Not only that, the Pope told everyone they have to help the refugees wherever they are.\"\nBut Father Leandre says the attitude of some conservative priests on the other side of the border, particularly in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, has complicated his work.\n\"The cardinal in Santo Domingo is personally very vocal in his support for the deportations. He supported sending all the Haitians back to their country.\"\n\"It's racism,\" he laments, saying the law specifically targeted black Haitians, a charge denied by lawmakers in the Dominican Republic.\nThe priest Father Leandre was referring to has been the most influential voice in the Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic for almost 40 years: the controversial and outspoken Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez.\nEarlier this month, Pope Francis accepted the cardinal's resignation, which all archbishops are obliged to offer once they reach the age of 75.\nBut he will remain an important figure in the Church and in Dominican public life.\nThe BBC repeatedly requested an interview with Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus so he could respond to the criticisms against him but both he and his press secretary declined.\nIn many ways, the Haitian migrant crisis has exposed greater divisions within the Catholic Church in Hispaniola over where it should position itself in the 21st Century.\nPope Francis - both the first Jesuit pope and the first from Latin America - designated 2016 as the \"Year of Mercy\" and certainly Jesuits have been instrumental in supporting the Haitian returnees.\nIn a video that went viral, the cardinal was filmed in a furious diatribe about a Jesuit priest called Mario Serrano calling him \"shameless\" and a \"leftist\".\n\"He's not very accustomed to being publically confronted,\" Mario Serrano tells me from the northern border region of Dajabon, where he works with undocumented Haitians.\n\"I just said that (his) kind of speech was not according to the Catholic teaching and was not for a priest or a Christian.\n\"I think that really made him mad.\"\nSupporters of the new regularisation law, such as the former Dominican ambassador to the US, Flavio Espinal, deny that the legislation was either cruel or motivated by racism.\n\"Nothing's perfect and the process here has not been perfect. Yet this has been an extraordinary step forward in the direction of regularising close to 300,000 people who were undocumented in this country.\n\"That's not an easy decision to make nowadays.\"\nAt night, to avoid detection, the farmer Soinicier Giles leaves Parc Cadeau and slips back into the Dominican Republic, the border marked by the Pedernales River.\nThere he strips the trees for firewood to make charcoal, to sell to Dominican traders for a few dollars.\nHe knows the practice damages the fertility of the soil, but it's the only available source of income.\n\"This is the only way we can survive,\" he says, motioning at his family, stuck inside the world's forgotten migrant crisis.\nYou can hear more of Will Grant's report on Heart and Soul on the BBC World Service.", "summary": "Immigration has long been a divisive issue on Hispaniola, the Caribbean island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic.", "id": "36896016"}
{"document": "Kevin Hyland told the BBC it was \"deeply concerning\" that hundreds of Nigerians were brought in every year for prostitution or forced labour.\nMr Hyland said the problem of such exploitation was \"enormous\".\nThe Home Office said it was \"committed to tackling modern slavery\" and was addressing specific issues in Nigeria.\nThe commissioner, who has only been in post for six months, says he can't think of anything more worrying than women and children being raped and forced into domestic servitude.\nLatest figures from the National Crime Agency show that more than 2,000 potential trafficking victims were referred to the authorities in 2014 - 244 of whom were from Nigeria, a 31 per cent increase from the previous year. The highest number of potential victims were identified as being from Albania.\nCampaigners believe the real figure of potential trafficking victims from Nigeria could be much higher, however.\nMr Hyland, the former head of the Metropolitan Police's human trafficking unit, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I am extremely concerned about this. And we're talking about several hundred every year.\n\"This isn't just a one-off - it's continuous - so the treatment of these people, what they go through, is actually a very serious crime, so for me it's a big problem.\n\"But also I think the fact that there is a demand for this kind of exploitation in the United Kingdom really concerns me, that there are people who will want to buy sex, will want to exploit, will want to have children as what are current-day slaves, so that is a really serious problem.\"\nResearch published by the Home Office in December estimates that there are between 10,000 and 13,000 potential victims of slavery in the UK.  Home Secretary Theresa May, speaking last year, described the scale of abuse as \"shocking\".\nMelissa (not her real name), who is in her 20s, was trafficked to the UK to work for a Nigerian woman in London as a domestic slave.\nFrom the age of 10, she was made to clean the kitchen, sell food on a market, feed and bathe other children, and go to school and do her homework.  She was beaten regularly, and locked in her room if she answered back.\nShe said: \"I know that this sounds unbelievable and the reason it sounds unbelievable is because, you know, who does that to someone?\n\"I don't understand the hatred because that's how I feel - hated. I felt I didn't do anything to deserve that and at some point I actually thought I was the one that was the problem, that there's something about me that's making her do that to me.\"\nTrafficking for the purpose of domestic service and other forms of exploitative labour is a widespread phenomenon in Nigeria.\nChildren and women are recruited to serve middle-class families in Nigeria or abroad. Domestic servants are sometimes poorer relatives, whose families think they will get a better life in a wealthier household. And this can happen, alongside the cases of abuse. Others servants are procured from rural areas, where there are few economic opportunities.\nWomen are also trafficked for prostitution, with a promise of a well-paid job but they end up realising too late that they have been lured into a debt bond by criminal gangs. This is a particular problem in the southern Edo state, where there is a long tradition of trafficking women to work as prostitutes in Italy.\nDebbie Ariyo, executive director of the charity Africans Unite Against Child Abuse, is adamant that the real number of those trafficked to the UK from Nigeria is much higher because many victims are reluctant to speak out.\nShe deals with hundreds of victims and believes the reasons for these people coming to the UK in the first place are the same.\nShe said: \"There is a notion among the families in Nigeria that once their family has come over here, they will have a better life, they will get better education, they will have better food and material things.\n\"A lot of people don't see the abuse and exploitation and many of the young people who've tried to tell their parents back home, it's difficult for the parents to accept that something like this could be happening in Britain.\"\nThe anti-slavery commissioner is calling for further prosecutions and for more victims to be identified, saying that a \"handful of convictions is not enough\".\nMr Hyland said: \"It's about working with the law enforcement agencies in Nigeria - working with all those in the communities and telling them this could happen - and that's never been brought together before so it's unique.\n\"This is a new idea - Europol, Interpol, National Crime Agency, all must work together. It's up to me to oversee this.\n\"This is not about lack of resources but about using them effectively.\"\nTatiana Jardan, director of the Human Trafficking Foundation charity, believes that combating this problem is easier said than done because it's a complex issue.\nShe said: \"We believe the role of the commissioner is crucial but solving this is not going to be easy.\n\"This is a difficult type of trafficking because Nigerians believe in witchcraft so they're worried about speaking out in case some harm comes to them. The police and other authorities desperately need more education so that they understand these complexities.\"\nA Home Office spokesman said: \"This government is committed to tackling modern slavery, including human trafficking, which is why the Modern Slavery Act 2015 was passed earlier this year.\n\"This legislation, the first of its kind in Europe, gives law enforcement the tools they need to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice and enhances protection for victims.\n\"The Modern Slavery Strategy, which was published in November last year, sets out an ambitious plan, including work with international partners, to increase collaboration and target human traffickers.\n\"We are already addressing the specific issue of human trafficking in Nigeria. This includes working closely with the National Crime Agency and the Nigerian National Agency for the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons to identify and disrupt Nigerian networks involved in the movement of potential victims.\"\nWith the commissioner only having been in post for six months, campaigners say it would be unfair to make an assessment now.\nSome argue the creation of his role in the first place is a sign the issue is being taken seriously.", "summary": "Clamping down on the problem of Nigerians being trafficked to the UK is a main priority, the first independent anti-slavery commissioner says.", "id": "33159899"}
{"document": "Born in Malaysia, of southern Indian heritage, he came here with his family 22 years ago, aged 13, and is now an up-and-coming presenter on the ABC news channel, News 24. He is one of the national broadcaster's rising stars.\nThis past week, however, in a classic case of a newsman himself making headlines, he has been the focus of a national conversation about Australian racism, having been the victim of the kind of ugly racist incident that usually goes unreported.\nMr Fernandez was riding on a bus through inner Sydney, when a small girl started pinching and flicking his two-year-old daughter.\nTo offer protection from what he thought was some pretty harmless child's play, he put his arm around his daughter, but still the girl persisted and then started flicking him. \"That was my arm,\" he told the child, at which point her mother let racist rip.\n\"She began hurling abuse and accused me of reaching behind our seats and touching her daughter,\" he recalled afterwards. \"Of course, I had not done anything of the sort.\"\nThen came the racist onslaught, which he described as \"the longest 15 minutes of my life\". His two-year-old daughter heard every single word of the rant, which culminated in foul-mouthed abuse.\nAlighting from the bus, he described to the driver what had happened. \"It's your fault, mate,\" responded the driver. \"You could have moved.\"\nIn the week that Americans celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birth of one of the great heroines of the struggle for black equality, Mr Fernandez described it as his very own \"Rosa Parks moment\". After dropping off his daughter at daycare, he cried.\nJeremy Fernandez shared the episode with his followers on Twitter, and it soon went viral.\n\"Anyone who says racism is dying is well and truly mistaken,\" he wrote, as part of a series of tweets. \"It's a sad thing when a coloured man in 2013 has to show his kid how to hold their nerve in the face of racist taunts.\" The conversation had started.\n\"Most people don't talk about this stuff,\" says Fernandez. \"That's why I think it touched a nerve. I honestly thought it would generate a bit of discussion for a couple of hours. I had no idea it would take off.\" Since last Friday, he has been contacted by about 6000 people.\nRacism has been part of the Australian story since the moment of white settlement in 1788. During the Gold Rush of the late 19th Century, fears that an overwhelmingly white nation could be overrun by non-whites bordered on the paranoid.\nThe White Australia policy, which restricted non-white immigration and which survived until the early 1970s, became in 1901 one of the first legislative acts of the new Australian parliament. The modern-day Australian story, however, is one of multicultural success.\nJust after World War II, over 90% of the 7.5 million Australians were of Anglo-Celtic stock. Since then, the population has tripled, with close to 45% of the population having at least one parent born in a foreign country. Now over 260 languages are spoken in Australia, and the country is made up of people with 270 different ancestries.\nFew countries have experienced such massive and rapid demographic change with such little violent backlash and rancour. Part of the reason why the Cronulla riot in 2005 was so jolting, for example, was because these kinds of racist eruptions were so exceptional.\nThe rise in the mid-1990s of Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party also cuts both ways. Revelling in her notoriety, the Queensland fish and chip shop owner came to personify Australian intolerance. Yet Hansonism proved a short-lived phenomenon, and its one-time figurehead is now a figure of fun.\nToday, there is no Australian equivalent of the British National Party. Nor is there an equivalent of the National Front, the English Defence League or other European far-right groups.\nRacial abuse and insensitivity, however, is widespread, which goes some way towards explaining why the country is often cast as a \"redneck nation\" - not least by Australians themselves. The tabloid and political hysteria surrounding the asylum seeker issue has echoes of a past in which a predominantly white nation felt insecure in a predominantly non-white region.\nThe comedian Barry Humphries, better known perhaps as Dame Edna Everage, struck a chord when he noted: \"Xenophobia is love of Australia.\"\nBut in an important new book, \"Don't Go Back to Where You Came From: why Multiculturalism Works,\" the academic Tim Soutphommasane argues that Australia now rivals Canada as the world's most successful multicultural country.\nThere has never been \"a numerically significant underclass of immigrants,\" he notes. Australia is one of the few OECD nations where the children of immigrants \"constitute a higher proportion of people in highly skilled occupations than the children of natives\".\nResidential segregation is not a is not a problem. Interracial marriage rates, a key indicator of ethnic integration, are high. By the third generation, a majority of Australians of non-English-speaking background marry partners with a different ethnic heritage.\nMr Soutphommasane bemoans the under-representation of immigrants in boardrooms, senior management, the military and parliament, which boasts just three lawmakers from non-European backgrounds, and highlights the problem of workplace discrimination.\nAs an immigrant himself - his parents were refugees from Laos - he has also been the victim of abuse and vilification, which he describes vividly in his book. Nonetheless, he argues: \"Australia has done multiculturalism well.\"\n\"Episodes like Jeremy's happen every day,\" he says, \"but they're not wholly representative of Australian society.\"\n\"It's important to resist the temptation for reflexive self-flagellation on racism,\" he adds. \"We tend to think of ourselves as the worst in the world, and we're not. We can some sometimes ignore the big picture, although these cases underscore the fragility of our achievement.\"\nJeremy Fernandez agrees that \"Australia is not a racist country\", but that these kind of ugly episodes are dispiriting. \"Even if it is once a month,\" he says, \"that's a lifetime of it happening 12 times a year.\"\nStill, the huge public response, online and in person, has heartened him.  \"It's overwhelmingly been message of goodwill,\" he says. \"That needs to speak as loudly as the incident itself.\"", "summary": "Jeremy Fernandez could easily be the face of the new Australia, a poster-boy of immigrant success.", "id": "21468892"}

{"document": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region.\nFor many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration.\nMr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame.\nA mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught.\nTo use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over.\nBut he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore.\nThe diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma.\nSince 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism.\nDomestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.\nHe was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.\nHis message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia.\nHis concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.\nMeasured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.\nThe much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.\nBut it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.\nThe democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled.\nSince the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.\nWhy West will miss Meles\nObituary: Meles Zenawi\nLife in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi\nA plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.\nFeeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.\nHe orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.\nHis death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.\nThat said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.\nThe opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.\nMr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.\nHe is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.\nHe did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.\nNot in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.\nFrom the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.\nMany embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nThe Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.\nHe swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.\nThe two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.\nHostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.\nIt is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.\nThat would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.\nIn Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.\nThe death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.\nThere are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.\nSuch fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.\nHowever, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.", "summary": "The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has thrown the populous Horn of Africa giant into a period of deep uncertainty and created a serious leadership vacuum in the region with profound geopolitical implications.", "id": "19341954"}
{"document": "It was 1993 and Muhammad Ali was in Glasgow signing books with his friend, the photographer, Howard Bingham.\nWe stood in that queue for three hours or more, people of all ages chatting about Ali and what he meant to them. There was an old man there - maybe 80. Twenty-three years later and his face is as clear in the mind's eye as it was then, when we inched our way forwards and listened to his stories.\nThis was no braggadocio. As Ali once said, 'It ain't bragging if you can back it up'. And that Glasgow man could definitely back it up. He spoke about being at Wembley when Clay beat Henry Cooper in 1963, about being at Earls Court when Ali took apart Brian London in 1966, about being in Dublin when Ali did Al 'Blue' Lewis in 1972.\nHe knew it all. He spoke - quietly and not at all boastfully - about attending Ali's fight with Karl Mildenberger in Germany. None of us so-called Ali aficionados in that slowly moving line had ever heard of Karl Mildenberger.\nSo when Ali's people lowered the boom about his death at the weekend, one of the first thoughts was for that wee man in 1993 and what happened when we eventually got to the top of the queue and entered the bookshop, like children heading into Santa's Grotto.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe did not ask for Ali's autograph or take his picture, he just stood away at the side and watched Ali do his thing. Then he became emotional. And Ali noticed.\nAli was exhausted - he should have been out of there hours before but he promised to stay until the last person left - and he did not have the strength to speak, but when he got up to leave he looked over at the old man, smiled as much as his illness would allow and then slowly put his up his fists, as if challenging him to a fight.\nThe old man did the same - and smiled back. It is funny the things you remember, but that one tender and fleeting image is impossible to forget.\nNo words were exchanged, but none were needed. Ali was the most eloquent man in the history of sport, but even when Parkinson's robbed him of his full voice he still moved people with the simplest gestures.\nSince his death, the eulogies have come thick and fast from all corners of the world and all spheres of society. There was not a nook or cranny on this planet that his legend did not reach.\nFor the best part of half a century he has inspired not just great sports writing but great literature. Hugh McIlvanney, Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, Norman Mailer, George Plimpton, Pete Hamill, Hunter S Thompson, Mark Kram, David Remnick, Thomas Hauser - all heavyweights in their own game, all with a body of work that will keep Ali's complexity and the epic sweep of his personality alive for eternity.\nIn looking back on his life, you have to look at the whole life, not just the best of it. Hagiography has no place in the Ali story. To accentuate the greatness at the expense of the ugliness would actually diminish what he was.\nAli was the most remarkable sportsman in history but he was also, at times, one of the most bigoted, one of the cruellest, one who preached love but delivered hate on to men like Joe Frazier, a man who tried to help Ali at his lowest ebb and got little back apart from racial hatred.\nAli became world champion in 1964 when shaking up the world in victory over Sonny Liston. He defended his title against Liston in 1965, the same year he came to Scotland to fight exhibition bouts at the Paisley Ice Rink.\nEven by then he was in the grip of the Nation of Islam, a frightening mob made up, in part, of ex-cons who preached a doctrine of separation of black and white. The integration of the races was a sin and they used Ali for all he was worth to get their message out there. No better man, no bigger audience.\nThis was one of the many contradictions of Ali. He was, as he said, free to be who he wanted to be, but he was not free at all in that period of his life, he was being manipulated remorselessly; ideologically and financially. The Nation got into Ali's head - and his bank account - to such a degree that he was, by the mid-1960s, espousing the view that any black person who had sexual relations with a white person should be killed.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe carried on that hateful mantra for years. You look at some of the television interviews he did with Michael Parkinson back then and you get chilled to the bone by Ali's thoughts. He came across as a Ku Klux Klan member in reverse.\nThe complexity of the man was profound. In 1967 - when still world champion - he appeared in front of the US Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station in Houston. The army wanted to enlist Ali for the war in Vietnam that day. If he had taken a step forward when his name was called out he would have been on the first bus out of Houston bound for Fort Polk, Louisiana and then onwards to Vietnam.\nAli never took the step. Everybody knew he was not going to take it. The FBI had his every move under surveillance. They regarded him as a subversive.\nAs soon as Ali conscientiously objected to the draft - 'Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong' - he was aware of what was coming.\nThe backlash was seismic. His title was stripped, his reputation trashed by white America and his life put at risk. He was not allowed to leave the country. Red Smith, one of the most influential sports columnists of the age, took out a literary blow-torch and let Ali have it. \"Squealing over the possibility that the military may call him up, Cassius makes himself as sorry a spectacle as those unwashed punks who picket and demonstrate against the war,\" he wrote.\nAli was branded a coward and a phony. David Susskind, the famous American television presenter and political commentator, went on TV with Ali and branded him \"a disgrace to his country, his race and what he laughably describes as his profession\". Susskind called Ali a \"simplistic fool\" who ought to be jailed.\nTime proved Ali right, of course. It cost him almost four years of his career and an estimated $10m, but his principled stance became a hallmark of his greatness - or one of them.\nAli said that he was prepared to die for what he believed in. Nobody doubted that there were people out there in 1960s America who would have wanted Ali dead.\nAli was suspended from boxing on April 28, 1967 and returned with a fight against Jerry Quarry on October 26, 1970. Those around him said then, and they've been saying it ever since, that the three-and-a-half years he lost would have been his peak years. Ali knew it, too. Not that it stopped him marching onwards into boxing history.\nHe now entered the Joe Frazier years - The Fight of the Century at Madison Square Garden in 1971, the Thrilla in Manila in 1975 and, in-between, the Rumble In The Jungle -  the reclaiming of his world title against George Foreman.\nAli versus Frazier - the blood feud trilogy - has spawned books and films and every new one that comes out adds another layer to what is surely the greatest rivalry in sporting history.\nWhat Ali did to Joe was shameful - and he was remorseful about it until the end. Joe lent Ali money and helped him get his boxing licence back. He went to the White House and asked president Richard Nixon to help Ali out.  Joe did not agree with Ali's stance on Vietnam but he felt it wrong that he was banned because of it. \"Not right to take away a man's pick and shovel\", was his immortal line.\nAli forgot all of that. When he fought Frazier first, in 1971, he belittled him in public. He called him dumb and ignorant and ugly. He called him ape man and the gorilla. Through the force of his oratory, Ali turned black America against Frazier. He said that anybody who supported Frazier was a traitor.\n\"The only people rooting for Joe Frazier,\" said Ali, \"are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs and members of the Ku Klux Klan. I'm fighting for the little man in the ghetto.\"\nFrazier was presented as an Uncle Tom - a grotesque distortion of his life, which was entrenched in the kind of poverty that Ali never knew. Their three fights were savage. \"The closest thing to dying,\" as Ali put it. Frazier was prepared to die, no doubt about it.\nRight to the end of his own life, in November 2011, Frazier held a grudge against Ali. He used to speak about Ali's Parkinson's and the fact that he could not talk much anymore and he would mock him. He would say that God sent him to fix Ali. \"He sent me to get him. I don't think that, I know that.\"\nAli said sorry to Joe many times over the years. He felt guilt and tried to make amends. It never quite worked out with Frazier, not in this world at least.\nAs he got older Ali became all about tolerance and love. All the hard edges softened and then disappeared. He lived out his life as a fighter of another kind, not the Louisville Lip, but a crusader against racism, injustice, crime, illiteracy, poverty. Those things, you sense, were of far greater importance to him than anything he achieved in the ring, from his first professional fight against Tunney Hunsaker at the Freedom Hall in his hometown of Louisville to his last, against Trevor Berbick, 21 years later.\n\"This life is nothing but a fraction of a second compared to eternity,\" Ali once said. \"You give God one good second and God will give you heaven for eternity.\"", "summary": "The queue snaked out of the side door of the book shop, 50 yards down the street, 100 yards down one side of an alleyway, 100 yards back up the other side and down the street again.", "id": "36458579"}
{"document": "Rafa Benitez's ill-fated reign had left Los Blancos trailing both Atletico Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga, with points dropped in four of their previous eight games and memories still fresh of a humiliating 4-0 home thrashing by Barca.\nNow, less than nine months later, not only are Zidane's Real the European champions, they are also on the verge of breaking La Liga's all-time record for consecutive victories.\nSunday's 2-0 triumph at Espanyol was the 16th straight victory for Zidane's men, who ended last season just one point behind champions Barca after winning their final 12 games. This season they have established early control of top spot with maximum points from four games.\nThat winning streak is a Real record and also equals the best winning sequence in Spain's top flight, achieved by Pep Guardiola's all-conquering Barca in 2010-11.\nAnd they have the chance to beat that on Wednesday with victory over Villarreal at the Bernabeu.\nSo, how has Zidane done it? Not in the way you might have expected.\nSaturday, 27 February 2016 was a major turning point in 44-year-old Zidane's early managerial career.\nReal lost their derby at home to Atletico 1-0, jeered off by dissatisfied fans who felt the team had failed to progress since Benitez's exit.\nUntil then, Zidane had shoe-horned as many attacking players into his line-ups as possible in an attempt to fulfil his pledge to deliver the kind of exciting, free-flowing football associated with his playing days.\nIt wasn't working. The forwards were getting in each other's way and the lack of defensive instincts in midfield was making the team vulnerable, brutally exposed by the way Atletico strolled unchallenged through the centre of the pitch for Antoine Griezmann's match-winner.\nZidane knew something had to change - and that something was the introduction of defensive midfielder Casemiro, the low-profile Brazilian who had previously only played 23 minutes under his management.\nCasemiro, 24, moved to the Bernabeu from Sao Paulo in February 2013, making his debut under Jose Mourinho in a 3-1 home win over Real Betis two months later.\nBut Carlo Ancelotti sent him on loan to Porto for the season in the summer of 2014, then he was largely left on the bench by Benitez and initially by Zidane, with both managers compromised by the pressure to field more flamboyant, attacking talents.\nHowever, derby defeat forced Zidane to rethink, and Casemiro rapidly became indispensable, with his powerful physique, tackling ability and positional discipline giving the team a previously lacking defensive presence in midfield.\nReal began their winning streak with a 3-1 triumph at Levante, and were five victories into it when the game that would prove to be their turning point arrived: the Clasico at Barcelona on 2 April.\nBarca were paying tribute to club legend Johan Cruyff, who had died a week earlier, and they had every intention of marking his memory with another crushing victory over their biggest rivals.\nInstead, it proved to be a prototype performance from Zidane's new-look team, who were undeterred by falling behind to Gerard Pique's header and bounced back to win with goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.\nThere was little flair in Real's victory, but the players obeyed Zidane's command - delivered in the wake of the defeat by Atletico - to \"run more\".\nNotably, the French coach delivered the same message in the build-up to the Champions League final against their city rivals in May, urging: \"What we have to do is run, run, run and run.\"\nForget spectacular, attacking football inspired by megastar Galacticos, Zidane was turning his team into a bunch of grafters committed to their defensive duties and increasingly confident in their ability to grind out wins even when not playing well.\nSeven of Real's past 19 victories have been secured by goals in the last 10 minutes - most recently the Champions League triumph over Sporting Lisbon which prompted Marca to hail them as \"Comeback FC\" and state Zidane has \"recovered the virtue of never giving up\".\nAlthough his strongest XI more or less picks itself, Zidane is committed to a policy of squad rotation, regularly emphasising the importance of a group mentality and insisting every player is important.\nEvery manager says similar things but Zidane's talk is not just empty rhetoric, with his commitment to rotation backed up by statistics.\nHe has fielded 21 players in Real's four league games this season - and only goalkeeper Kiko Casilla (deputising for Keylor Navas) and Sergio Ramos have started all four.\nFurthermore, Zidane has selected five different forward lines in his team's six competitive games, and their 12 league goals have been scored by 11 different players. You can't get much more 'group mentality' than that.\nSpain's most famously pro-Real journalist, Tomas Roncero from newspaper AS, this week saluted Zidane by writing: \"Zidane leads a squad of 24 players, not 11.\n\"This squad doesn't just have a plan B, but also a plan C and plan D. I've never seen a Madrid so complete, versatile, and reliable.\"\nThat tribute is also, naturally, an unspoken dig at Barcelona, who are routinely accused of being too reliant upon their Messi-Suarez-Neymar forward line and, when the second-stringers started at home to Alaves 10 days ago, lost 2-1.\nNot many managers could leave out a player for months, recall him to the starting line-up, see him score a record-breaking goal and then hear that player declare the manager \"will always be my idol\".\nBut Zidane was given that endorsement by James Rodriguez after the Colombia international, making his first start of the season, rifled home the opener in Real's hard-earned 2-0 victory at Espanyol on Sunday.\nAnd it's clear that Zidane, a 1998 World Cup winner with France who became a Real legend with a brilliant volley in the 2002 Champions League final victory over Bayer Leverkusen, is benefitting from the credibility provided by his stellar playing career.\nZidane commands automatic respect - and his aura makes it easier for him to retain good relationships with players he leaves out of the team.\nSo, too, does his constant reassertion of the team ethic and his commitment to squad rotation - it's much easier for dropped players to stay motivated when they know they have a genuine chance of starting next week.\nConsidering his penchant for petulance during his playing days, it is perhaps surprising that another quality which has helped Zidane manage Real's egos is his calm and composed personality.\nWhether on the sidelines, in front of the media or at the training ground, Zidane looks relaxed and always ready to smile, even maintaining his good-humoured patience when asked, as he has been countless times this summer, whether he was intending to sell James.\nIf you ask Barcelona fans whether Zidane is a great manager, they will scoff and say he is a lucky manager.\nWhen asked on social media for his hopes from the Champions League, Barca star Pique ironically replied he would like the kind of campaign enjoyed by Real last season.\n\"Easy group. Third-placed team in Italy in the last 16 [Roma], eighth in Germany in the quarters [Wolfsburg], fourth in England in the semis [Man City]. Return leg always at home,\" Pique tweeted.\nAnd it's true that Real - with all those late winners - have enjoyed some fortune during their record-breaking run, most recently when Sergio Ramos avoided a second yellow card for handball at Espanyol on Sunday by successfully pretending the ball hit his face.\nAlthough the \"lucky\" argument only takes you so far, it's certainly too soon to proclaim Zidane as an unqualified coaching triumph. The season is young and it's never wise to bank on too much stability in the soap opera that is Real Madrid.\nNevertheless, a Champions League title and 16 straight league wins cannot be discounted lightly - and victory over Villarreal would be another step forward in Zidane's coaching career, which is so far threatening to be every bit as successful as his playing career.", "summary": "When Zinedine Zidane was appointed Real Madrid manager in January, the Spanish giants were in disarray.", "id": "37420223"}

And by the way, I'm employed by the following company'.\"\nHe also warned that where solicitors' firms currently competed on the basis of excellence, new corporate providers would be under pressure to give advice that was in their financial interests.\nThe Bar Council's comments came in its 150-page response to a Ministry of Justice consultation on the issue, which ends later.\nMaura McGowan QC, chairwoman of the Bar Council, said: \"There is no avoiding the simple fact that these proposals would move us from having a justice system which is admired all over the world, to a system where price trumps all.\"\nThe Bar Standards Board, which is responsible for regulating barristers, said the plans to pay legal aid lawyers the same amount for a \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" plea could lead to defendants being pressurised into pleading guilty.\nIt said cases where the defendant entered an initial guilty plea were typically shorter and so cheaper.\nChairwoman Baroness Ruth Deech said: \"These reforms may endanger the ability of our legal system to guarantee everyone a fair trial. \"\nThe Association of Prison Lawyers said the plans would effectively remove legal aid for all prison law issues other than parole hearings and disciplinary hearings dealt with by magistrates.\n\"The changes will mean that funding will no longer be available for such important matters as the separation of mothers and babies, prisoners being held in solitary confinement and access to rehabilitative programmes,\" it added.\nThe Children's Society says it is particularly concerned by the proposed introduction of a residency test to determine eligibility.\nChief executive Matthew Reed said: \"These proposals will see the UK block access to legal aid for vulnerable children, undermining their rights and leaving some of the most marginalised young people without help.\"\nJustice Secretary Chris Grayling said: \"At a time of major financial challenges, the legal sector cannot be excluded from the government's commitment to getting better value for taxpayers' money.\n\"We believe costs paid to lawyers through legal aid should reflect this.\"\nThe Ministry of Justice added that a disposable income cap of \u00a337,500 per household would mean only those on a six-figure salary or above would be prevented from having automatic access to legal aid.\nLabour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said there was \"considerable waste and bureaucracy\" in the criminal justice system.\n\"But the government's proposals ignore these potential savings, and instead impose a model for legal aid which prioritises the cost of legal representation ahead of quality.\"\nIn April, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act removed legal aid from many areas of civil law.", "summary": "Plans to overhaul legal aid in England and Wales would remove the right of defendants to choose a solicitor, a retired senior judge has warned.", "id": "22762984"}
{"document": "She plays a no-nonsense character in House of Cards, and in real life Robin Wright is no different.\nFor four seasons, viewers have seen her in the role of Claire Underwood, the Machiavellian partner of stop-at-nothing politician, Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey.\nBoth actors have also directed and produced episodes of the show. But while their roles are equally prominent, for years their salaries were not in parity.\n\"I was like, 'I want to be paid the same as Kevin.' It was a perfect paradigm and example to use, because there are very few films or TV shows where the male\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe patriarch and the matriarch are equal. And they are in House of Cards,\" she told an audience at New York's Rockefeller Foundation.\nWright looked at statistics which showed that for some time, her character was more popular than Spacey's.\n\"So I capitalised on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and they did.'\"\nWright's success at equalising her pay is a story to be noted, because it is still incredibly rare.\n\"She is playing a popular and important character in a series. She has leverage and she used it,\" says Lisa Maatz, vice president for government relations at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), which has conducted research into the broader issue.\n\"I admire her for standing up to them. Not everybody is going to be as fortunate. But her situation in terms of being underpaid is far too common.\"\nUS government statistics show that on average, women are paid less than their male counterparts, 79 cents for every dollar a man earns.\nAccording to the White House, the median wage of a woman working full-time all year in America is about $39,600 (\u00c2\u00a327,116), 79% of a man's median earnings, which stand at $50,400.\nThe statistic is widely used to illustrate the discrepancy in pay across the sexes, and looks across all sectors.\nIn Fresno, California, Aileen Rizo took a similar stand against her employer after she learned she was receiving less pay than a new male employee, who didn't have a masters degree like she did.\nMs Rizo had been working as a maths consultant for four years for Fresno County Office of Education, when she found out that the new hire was being paid at the highest salary scale (a nine), while she was being paid at the lowest (a one).\nWhen she confronted her human resources department about the difference, she was told it wasn't a mistake. \"They said they'd used my prior pay as a guide, and that's why I was on less,\" she explained.\nMs Rizo began legal action against her employers in 2013, who argued they set wages based on the employee's most recent salary, plus a five percent increase. Experience wasn't a determining factor, they said.\nRepresentatives for Fresno County pointed out that a woman working in the same department as Ms Rizo, was being paid more, and said that in the past 25 years more women had been on higher salary scales, than men in the same or similar position in the department.\nThe court ruled in Ms Rizo's favour, arguing that the fact another woman earned more than her, shouldn't diminish her right to a fair wage.  Her employers appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.\nSince she began her lawsuit, Ms Rizo is now receiving the same pay as her male colleague, but she continues to fight for backdated wages. She also testified before the California legislature, which has since passed an Equal Pay Act in the state.\nWhile she believes employers need to be more transparent and fair, she does also think women could also do more.\n\"We do need to get better at negotiating. I was trusting an organisation to act in a way of integrity. I took for granted that that's where everyone started.\"\n\"Whether you have to file a lawsuit or demand it and get it, women need to empower others and educate society about a problem that's still evident,\" she says.\nBut the scale of the problem is something which is widely debated.\nSome critics say the \"79 cents for every dollar\" statistic is misleading, because it doesn't compare two people working in the same job, with the same background and qualifications. When those factors are taken into account, there still is a gender pay gap, but the percentage difference is much smaller, at around 7%.\n\"The idea that when a young woman graduates, the idea she's going to get paid 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, working in the same job, across our economy is a myth,\" argues Karin Agness, who is president of the Network of Enlightened Women, a conservative policy group.\nMs Agness believes that the 79 cents statistic gives young graduates a false impression of the workplace they're about to enter.\n\"It creates a victim mentality in women, and we don't want our young women going into the workforce thinking they are victims just because they are women,\" she says.\nBut Lisa Maatz from the AAUW says both measures are valid - one is more general, the other specifically compares similar roles - but both point to a discrepancy which needs to be addressed.\n\"The gender wage gap has many causes and contributors, including differences in education, experience, occupation and industry, and family responsibilities. But even after accounting for these factors, a gap still remains between men's earnings and women's earnings,\" argues a White House report on the issue.\nData on the pay gap for Hispanic and black women shows greater disparities. The gap between similar jobs fluctuates wildly based on the sector. And even controlling for similar jobs, the gap grows for women who are promoted into the director and executive level.\nFor Ms Maatz, there are other areas which also need to be addressed when it comes to wage disparity, for example the rise of so-called \"pink collar\" jobs, in which certain roles such as nurses, secretaries and teachers, are devalued simply because more women do them.\nBut Robin Wright's experience is a reminder that the gender pay gap affects women across all professions. She hopes her example will encourage other women to speak up.\n\"It's a male dominant workplace society. It always has been. And that's just the history.\n\"But it has to be unacceptable at this stage.\"\nFollow Rajini Vaidyanathan on Twitter - @BBCRajiniv", "summary": "House of Cards star Robin Wright has revealed she demanded the same pay as her co-star Kevin Spacey - but what does fighting for equal wages look like for women who are not movie stars?", "id": "36327826"}

In that debut at Brookline he demonstrated a Tigger-like enthusiasm for these biennial jousts that has never dimmed.\n\"The drive to do well and obviously win, it's still the same,\" he said. \"Once you put your clothes on and your shoes on and you step on the first tee, you still want to beat them as hard as you can.\"\nIn foursomes he's won eight of eleven matches while his dependable driving makes the Spaniard a huge asset in the fourballs. The world number three is in fine form as well; in his last eight tournaments he boasts five top 10 finishes, including three runner-up positions.\n\"We know how important the Ryder Cup is to all of us, how much it means to be part of this team; how difficult it is to be part of this team,\" Garcia added.\nIt's conceivable the Spaniard could team up with McIlroy in the Friday morning fourballs, especially if McGinley decides to break up the world number one's partnership with Poulter.\nIt was with McIlroy at his side at Medinah where Poulter unleashed his closing spell of Saturday evening birdies that began the remarkable European comeback from 10-4 down two years ago.\nPoulter could also pair up with his old mate Rose, but that's more likely to happen in the alternate shot format rather than Friday morning fourballs. Rose paired with Henrik Stenson looks a good match-up for the better ball format and the Englishman will feel ready to play a lead role.\nOddly enough, this is only the third Ryder Cup for the 34-year-old and his first on home soil. Rose played in the defeat in 2008 and starred on the final day at Medinah two years ago.\nThat extraordinary session feels like a lone day of success in his Ryder Cup career. \"Until that point we were being well and truly beaten,\" Rose told BBC Sport.\n\"And in the previous Ryder Cup at Valhalla we were on the losing end of it there. So I've experienced six days of Ryder Cup golf and five of them have been pretty bleak.\"\nBut that tumultuous final day when the bleakness lifted proved the launch pad for Rose's career. His clutch putts on the final two holes to beat Phil Mickelson delivered a vital point for Europe but also provided a vital boost to the Englishman's self-assurance.\nIt undoubtedly helped him win the US Open in 2013. \"I was surprised how comfortable I felt down the stretch at Merion,\" he admitted. \"That's due to all the experiences I've had in the game and a big part of that was Ryder Cup.\n\"As a kid you wonder how these guys stand up to the pressure and I'm not really sure how we do it, but you trust your training and you get into it. To be able to pull off some of the great shots I did down the stretch you have to take confidence from that.\"\nRose is one of four major winners in the European team and the man who succeeded him as US Open champion, Martin Kaymer, is another.\nThe German, who holed the putt that retained the trophy two years ago, could partner McIlroy in foursomes and is expected to play a much more senior role this time. He made only two appearances in the victory two years ago.\nGraeme McDowell is helping to shepherd Victor Dubuisson through his debut, while Lee Westwood is providing a similar role with the other rookies Stephen Gallacher and Jamie Donaldson.\nDespite their 2010 and 2012 victories, Europe are desperate to improve on a record in which they have won only two of the last nine sessions. McGinley's attention to detail should ensure they contend well in the foursomes and fourballs.\nBut as Rose points out the opposition is strong. \"They've got a wonderful team,\" he said. \"I don't really buy into the whole underdog thing. The last two Ryder Cups have come down to just one point each time.  It's going to be tight, I'm pretty sure of that.\"\nThere are ready made partnerships in Tom Watson's side.

{"document": "MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer looks at the reasons why Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side won the Premier League by such a convincing margin and explains why it will be hard to stop them achieving more success.\nEvery part of their team did their bit but the biggest reason for their success is one man, Jose Mourinho. His influence was huge.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and he knows exactly how to get what he wants.\nI don't accept the 'boring boring Chelsea' jibes his side have faced recently. I think that is utter rubbish.\nIt is not Chelsea's problem if teams cannot beat them, and it is pretty embarrassing if they then call them boring.\nThe only tag the Blues deserve is 'worthy champions' because that is what they are. Everyone else has a lot of catching up to do.\nOne of the biggest reasons Chelsea won the title is that, unlike his rivals, Mourinho identified what he needed last summer, and went out and got it.\nI am sure he was hurt by what happened to Chelsea last season, his first back at Stamford Bridge since his last spell ended in 2007.\nDespite not having a really top-class centre-forward they went very close to winning the title.\nNear-misses don't mean anything to Mourinho, though.\nHe addressed the main issue holding his side back by signing Diego Costa, who has scored the goals that were missing.\nChelsea were also lacking a bit of guile in midfield, and Cesc Fabregas has provided the extra creativity there.\nHis midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho signed in January 2014 to sit and police the back four, is just one part of a team system that works perfectly.\nChelsea have some top players, but their squad also has a great hunger and desire. That is down to their manager.\nBy the end of the season, Chelsea will have broken the record for the most days spent on top of the table, and also the most consecutive days.\nThey were joint-top with Manchester City at the start of January but, since they kicked their first ball of the campaign, the only time they have not been at the summit was after the second round of games.\nTheir players had the character to deal with it. From August onwards, they have been the team to beat and the best team full-stop.\nThat underlines their consistency over the last nine months, and shows the almost total control they have had on the title race.\nEven when they were hit for five by Tottenham on New Year's Day, no panic set in.\nThat was one of their very few bad days, which are inevitable over a long season, but they never suffered a slump for a sustained period of time.\nThey have never had to play catch-up in the title race and are not used to doing it in individual games either. Again, they are usually in control.\nThey have scored the first goal in 27 out of their 35 league matches, which is obviously important for any team, but especially for Chelsea.\nWhen you have a defence like they do, they are very rarely pegged back when they get in front.\nI keep hearing that players need to be rested and rotated but Chelsea don't do it, and their approach seems to have helped rather than hindered them.\nInstead, Mourinho uses a core group of players who start whenever they are available.\nThat includes Eden Hazard, who is hardly ever taken off either, something that is rare for an attacking player.\nAt the back, John Terry has been magnificent and he has played every single minute of every league game.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe rest of the back four - Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta - play whenever they are fit.\nCompare them to, say, Manchester City who chop and change their defence a lot and you can see the benefit of a settled unit who work relentlessly together.\nChelsea have had 17 clean sheets out of 35 league games, and they have only conceded more than two goals twice.\nThey were pretty good at the back in the first half of the season when they were scoring goals freely. Until 17 January, only Southampton had conceded fewer goals.\nBut in the past few weeks when they have been more pragmatic in the way they have been getting results, they have been even better at the back.\nFrom August to January, Chelsea played some sparkling football and you only have to look at their attacking statistics to see that they were anything but dull.\nSo they earned the right to play the way they have been in the last few weeks, when they have been protecting their lead at the top of the table.\nI put that change in approach down to form and fitness of some of their players, with Costa's absence being the obvious example.\nThe important thing was that Chelsea kept winning, though, and they have done that.\nNone of their rivals have managed it over the duration of the season and the way I would sum up this campaign is that Chelsea have been brilliant and the rest of the league has not been good enough - by quite a margin.\nCity, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been disappointing, especially when you look at the money they have spent, because they are further away from Chelsea now than they have been for a while.\nChelsea have done the job they set out to do at the start of the season, which is to win the title.\nThey have the best defensive record in the Premier League and only City have scored more goals. They also have the best player, Hazard.\nPut all of that together and I just cannot accept they are dull.\nThey have not got the credit they deserve but I don't think that bothers Mourinho one iota.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe only thing that matters to him is winning the Premier League, and he has done that with ease.\nHe has his third title in English football, and now he will want more.\nHe can get that with this Chelsea team, which certainly does not need much work done to it over the summer.\nI am pretty sure a centre-forward will be high on Mourinho's shopping list because we have seen how much they have missed Costa when he has been out.\nAlso, Didier Drogba is 37 now and I am not sure how long he can keep going.\nBut the main thing for Chelsea is that Mourinho is not going anywhere - while he is around, there are more trophies to come.\nAlan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "summary": "I tipped Chelsea to win the title in August and there was not one moment during the whole season that I did not think they would end up as champions.", "id": "32570115"}
{"document": "Through the long, hot summer of 1976 Hunt's attempt to claw back a huge points deficit to reigning champion Lauda was big news in Britain.\nThe season was so dramatic it inspired director Ron Howard to make the 2013 film Rush.\nHowever, almost the entire season - including the British Grand Prix - was not broadcast on television in the UK because one of the cars was sponsored by a condom manufacturer.\nBBC Sport tells the story of how a forward-thinking contraception company led to an F1 blackout, as the sport draped itself in cigarette advertising.\nForty years ago, moral standards and sensitivities were different in Britain, while levels of advertising on TV, particularly in sporting events, would often be a source of angst.\nJonathan Martin, who was a producer on BBC's Sportsnight in '76 and would go on to create the Grand Prix programme two years later, says that F1 \"already had a special place\" because \"broadcasters had to tolerate\" on-car advertising, while \"in many other sports it was invisible\".\nAfter all, on-shirt advertising was not allowed in televised league football matches in England until 1983.\nIn '76 not all F1 races were televised in the UK, with coverage generally focused on glamour events such as Britain, Monaco, Germany and Italy.\nBut these would all be blacked out when John Surtees signed a sponsorship deal with the London Rubber Company, which would see his team's main F1 car emblazoned with the Durex brand.\nThe tipping point came at the non-championship Race of Champions at Brands Hatch in March, which the BBC was due to televise with Murray Walker commentating.\nIn his autobiography, Walker recalled: \"As far as the BBC was concerned a visible Durex logo was totally unacceptable for family viewing.\n\"I arrived at Brands Hatch to be greeted by producer Ricky Tilling with the words: 'Hi Murray, we'll know by 11am whether we're going to be on air or not.'\n\"'What are you talking about, Ricky?'\n\"'Durex. We're not going to transmit the race unless Surtees agree to take it off their cars.'\"\nThey did not, so the BBC packed up their cameras and left.\nSurtees, the only man to win the world championship in F1 (1964) and on 500cc motorbikes (1956, '58, '59, '60), had set up his own team in 1970 but they struggled at the top level.\nFinance, or the lack of it, was always an issue so it was almost a lifeline when the team was approached by the London Rubber Company with a sponsorship proposal \"offering a decent sum of money\".\nSurtees recalls: \"I said to them we would have to sit down and do it in a very wholesome and presentable way.\n\"I thought it would cause a stir but the fact remains that there was nothing sleazy about it and we weren't breaking any rules.\n\"It revitalised the team and gave it a second chance.\"\nAccording to Martin, the Surtees sponsorship \"caused a flurry at management level\" at the BBC and ITV, who also broadcast occasional F1 races at the time.\n\"Grand prix racing already had a special place and then when Durex appeared on the side of a car, there were certain apoplectic people around,\" he said.\nF1 in 1976 was all about Hunt and Lauda, the flamboyant British playboy and the methodical but brilliant Austrian. Although the two men got on well, conflict and argument was never far away.\nLauda had a 26-point lead when the cars went to Brands Hatch for the British Grand Prix in July but Hunt had won the previous race in France and had his points for finishing first in Spain reinstated after he had initially been disqualified.\nA record crowd descended on the Kent circuit on a scorching day to roar Hunt on, but it appeared that his race was over when his McLaren was damaged in a first-lap crash that caused the race to be stopped.\nStewards looked to set stop Hunt from taking part in the restart because he had not completed a full lap of the track when the original race was red-flagged.\nHowever, they soon changed their minds when the restless, sun-burned crowd began to slow-handclap, chant \"we want Hunt\" and throw missiles onto the circuit.\nCheers erupted when Hunt appeared on the grid and they were even louder when he won from Lauda to cut the Austrian's lead to 23 points.\nThe only TV coverage of the race in Britain was a short film shown on ITV's World of Sport a week after the event.\nTwo weeks on from Hunt's home win, Lauda almost died when his Ferrari exploded into flames in a crash at the notorious Nurburgring in the German Grand Prix. He suffered horrific burns, damage to his lungs and was given the last rites.\nThe Austrian survived and incredibly was back racing six weeks later at the Italian Grand Prix, by which time his championship lead was only two points over Hunt.\nThe press and the public were rapt. But, the short Brands Hatch film aside, British TV continued with its unofficial boycott of F1.\nLauda extended his championship lead to five points when Hunt spun off in Italy and the game appeared up when Ferrari's protest against Hunt's Brands Hatch win was upheld and the Briton was disqualified. The gap was now 17 points with three races to go.\nBut Hunt won in Canada and the United States, collecting 18 points while Lauda only managed two. It set up a showdown at the final race in Japan with the Austrian's lead down to three points.\nAt the BBC, it was time for a rethink.\n\"The Hunt-Lauda battle captured the public imagination,\" recalls Martin, who went on to become the BBC's head of sport.\n\"Especially when it went down to the last race in Japan, the management climbed down very rapidly off their social engineering stance.\n\"I was in the forefront of saying: 'Come on, we've got to go and do this' but I was helped in that by the fact that ITV were starting to think in the same way.\"\nITV had shown highlights of the penultimate race in the US and both broadcasters scheduled highlights of the Japanese GP.\nTorrential rain in Fuji delayed the start and when it did eventually get under way, Lauda decided to retire after two laps as he considered the conditions too dangerous. Hunt splashed around the soaked circuit to finish third and take the title by a single point.\nAnd, finally, British viewers were able to enjoy the drama.\nSurtees, now 82 and still a keen follower of F1, says he was disappointed that the Durex sponsorship proved so unpalatable.\n\"It was purely a question of the BBC making their decision. From the point of view of the sport, I was very unhappy,\" he said.\n\"It was very important for the sport to be able to give a good platform for people to support it. It didn't make me happy that the BBC took that position.\n\"I thought it was ill-advised considering so many government agencies were out there pushing these products.\"\nMartin, who says the interest generated by the Hunt-Lauda battle was the reason he suggested to BBC management that they should cover every F1 race from 1978, can see both sides of the argument.\n\"With hindsight, it was a fairly provocative thing to do. He was within his rights to do it just as the broadcasters were within their rights,\" he said.\n\"I think it pushed the broadcasters to the limit because F1 already had special dispensation compared with many, many other sports.\"\nSubscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.", "summary": "It was arguably the most famous season in Formula 1 history, featuring thrilling racing, off-track controversies and the near-death of the sport's most famous driver, Niki Lauda, as he battled James Hunt for the world championship.", "id": "35748458"}
{"document": "The initial plan was to pass ownership to supporters' group Well Society in five years, but instead it has taken 14 months for the handover to be agreed.\nThis was always going to be the final outcome, since Hutchison was never interested in owning or running the club long-term.\nFor him, a Lanarkshire boy whose business career took him abroad and eventually into a life of significant wealth, the point was to contribute to his local community.\nChallenges remain, though, even if Hutchison believes much of the hard work has been carried out.\nThe significant progress is that costs have been cut, that investments have been made on infrastructure projects at Fir Park and on improving the chances of the football side of the business contributing to self-sustainability.\nHutchison is satisfied that in agreeing to sell his 76% shareholding for \u00a31 to the Well Society, he has paved the way for stability and fan ownership.\nIf there is a message from Hutchison, it is that fans and local businesses need to step up to support the club financially, so that it never needs to be reliant on wealthy individuals or investors.\n\"I can't speak to the future of any business, whether it's secure or otherwise, but if they have enough customers and they follow the strategy which has been implemented, we've significantly improved the probability of success,\" Hutchison told BBC Scotland from his home in Barbados.\n\"[The club] is extremely close [to break even]. In recent months, the player budget has been reduced dramatically, we've been able to sign some really excellent younger players on longer-term contracts, which reduces costs because you don't have to buy a much more experienced player, we've significantly reduced the medical bills by the introduction of the sports scientist.\n\"We could do with a little bit of a boost on the commercial side, but we have that pipeline of young talent coming through which would give the opportunity for additional transfer income.\n\"What [supporters] need to do is decide whether or not they want to try to make it work and whether they want to step up.\n\"The second, and probably more important one, is that I'd like to see more local companies participate more effectively with the club and the community.\"\nHutchison had to address costs at Fir Park since the club was running at a loss.\nBefore John Boyle's controlling interest was transferred in January 2015, Hutchison had to provide \u00a330,000 to pay bills. He has since invested \u00a3650,000 and \u00a3380,000 in loans, with at least \u00a3180,000 having been paid back, and the remaining repayment terms altered.\nMotherwell previously used to budget to finish in the top half of the Premiership, which meant that any drop in form had a significant impact on working capital.\nThat has changed, while 10 players left the club in January, although one of them - James McFadden - subsequently signed a new short-term deal until the end of the season.\nUnder Mark McGhee's management, the focus is to be on developing young players, and Hutchison is particularly proud that under his tenure, Motherwell have reached the youth cup final for the first time in 30 years.\nThe challenge, though, is financial as well as sporting. The income streams of football clubs rise and fall over the course of a season, but there is now no wealthy individual on hand to cover any shortfalls that might arise.\nThe Well Society's membership has plateaued, with some letting their subscriptions slide. The Society needs all of its members to be contributing and for more to join if money is to be raised to support the fan-ownership model.\n\"People got into a bit of a comfort zone that maybe they don't have to participate, 'it's okay, Les is here, don't worry about it',\" Hutchison said.\n\"From the very outset, I wasn't in the business of wanting to own or run a football club in Scotland, I am a philanthropist and I was trying to help the community.\n\"The Society have had up to 1700 people who have at some point in time contributed. All it takes is for people who have done it in the past to do it again and a few more, with also the support of local business who really want to support their local communities and customers, they need to step up a bit more as well.\n\"If that happens, then the thing will be in good hands.\n\"What [the club] has to do is manage the cash flow. That's the challenge. The cash comes in in peaks and troughs because of the way the league does their financing and the way that sponsors pay their money, and TV and so on.\n\"If they could build up some reasonable reserves, they can then manage through the peaks and troughs.\n\"We've been budgeting quite prudently. We've had to take actions to make sure those budgets can be achieved. It all bodes well at this point.\"\nHutchison has stabilised Motherwell - at a personal cost of \u00a31m - and has now left the supporters with the opportunity, and the challenge, of taking over. For that to happen, the Well Society will need to succeed in a way that it hasn't been able to achieve in the past.", "summary": "Les Hutchison's involvement at Motherwell has ended before he expected it to.", "id": "35826768"}

On the ground floor, young men lounge awkwardly in hard-backed chairs, waiting for their turn on the computers lined up on one side of the room. Those in front of the machines don headsets and hold ebullient Skype conversations.\nUpstairs, the atmosphere is completely different. Bewildered-looking families gather in a stuffy \"safe space\" operated by Save The Children. Parents usher their children over to a pile of toys, while a small boy cries inconsolably. The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room.\n\"They are Yazidi people from Iraq,\" says Marjan, a translator struggling to find a common language with the new arrivals.\nThere are more than two dozen people in this extended family group. They did not follow the classic route to Serbia via Greece and Macedonia, but came over the country's eastern border with Bulgaria.\nIn the centre's strip-lighted, windowless meeting room, the overflowing ashtrays and half-drunk mugs of Turkish coffee suggest that it has been a stressful morning. The centre's manager, Vladimir Sjekloca, breaks off to explain the situation.\n\"There are always people in Belgrade,\" he says. \"Around 400-500 a day.\"\nVladimir says the increasing restrictions imposed by countries along the Balkan route - and finally its official closure (although hundreds of people have found a way through the border fence to cross from Greece into Macedonia) - have not stopped people seeking a way to western Europe. They have just changed the means.\n\"Coming in through Bulgaria - it's an old smuggling route and it'll be used more often. The Afghans tell us, 'It's cheaper to come that way [than the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece] and anyway we can't swim.'\"\nBefore its closure, countries along the route had been co-ordinating transport so that people would be taken from Macedonia to Slovenia's border with Austria on officially provided trains and buses. It was a reasonably smooth process which greatly reduced the possibility of refugees falling into the hands of people smugglers.\nBut now people who are desperate or determined to reach western Europe are once again dealing with unscrupulous elements.\n\"The journey through Bulgaria is full of ill-treatment,\" says Vladimir.\n\"People suffer at the hands of the mafia and people smugglers - and they don't get protection from the system. In fact, they can get ill-treated by the Bulgarian police or put in jail. They have set dogs on refugees - we've seen people with dog bites who've been severely beaten by the mafia or the police.\"\nSome of the people at the Asylum Information Centre have learned the hard way that people smugglers and even the authorities may not have their best interests at heart.\nAli Hashem Zade, a 27-year-old native of Tehran had hoped to find work in Europe to help support his two infant daughters.\nBut when Macedonia blocked entry to Iranians, he placed his trust in a trafficker from Pakistan.\n\"The smugglers were our only hope after they closed the border to Iranians. He took \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 (\u00c2\u00a3195) from me - but he had a different price for everyone. He charged some people \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,400 - but he actually ran away, and I ended up wandering along the border for two days - I had to burn some of my clothes to start a fire,\" he says.\nAli says he found his way over the border by using his phone's GPS - but the same method did not work when he tried to cross from Serbia into Croatia. He claims the Croatian border police beat him and his friends when they caught them.\nStill, he means to try again.\n\"I have no money - so I will rely on God's will. It's better to rely on God than smugglers.\"\nOther people at the Asylum Information Centre are deciding to stay in Serbia - for now, at least. Taxis arrive to take the families to another asylum centre in Krnjaca, in the suburbs of Belgrade.\nIn the Yugoslav era, this rundown facility with the feel of a military barracks used to be workers' accommodation for an adjacent factory. Now the single-storey blocks house asylum seekers waiting for their claims to be processed. They share the facility with a handful of refugees displaced in the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s.\nIvan Miskovic from the government's Refugees Commissariat explains that people stranded when the Balkan route shut have a number of options. As well as asylum in Serbia they include repatriation, resettlement in a third country or an application to be reunited with family members who have already made it to western Europe.\n\"I think we did our job by offering them all the possibilities,\" he says. \"But our previous experience tells us that Serbia is not their destination, but their country of transit.\"\nSerbia has consistently taken a pragmatic approach to the refugee crisis - whether that has meant helping people on their way when the borders were open, or, more recently, mirroring the entry restrictions of neighbouring countries. Now there is a sense of realism about what the coming weeks might bring.\n\"The borders are not hermetically closed,\" says Ivan Miskovic. \"It is inevitable that more people will come in. Even if they come in an irregular fashion, they must be registered - and we can help them to be less vulnerable.\n\"But even if they start the asylum procedure [to stay in Serbia], they are simply buying time to leave the country when they find a suitable connection.\"\nIn other words, the Balkan route carries on.", "summary": "The Balkan route may officially be closed, but the Asylum Information Centre in Belgrade is very much open - and doing a roaring trade.", "id": "35801175"}
{"document": "The Education Policy Institute think tank has produced a league table of academy trusts and councils in England.\nDavid Laws, former schools minister and the institute's chairman, said successive governments had been \"in denial\" about failing academies.\nThe Local Government Association said it showed academies were no \"magic bullet\" for improving schools.\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"Our ambition remains for all schools to become academies.\"\nMr Laws said that when he served as education minister in the coalition government there had been internal data showing weaknesses in academy trusts, but there had been a reluctance to publish such information when ministers were promoting academy expansion.\nBut the Education Policy Institute has now published its own rankings showing how local authorities compare with multi-academy trusts with at least five schools.\nThe findings show that academy trusts are among the most and least successful at improving pupil performance, at both primary and secondary level.\nIn between is a spread of success and underachievement, with the analysis concluding that there is little overall difference between academy trusts and local authorities.\nThe average for academy trusts and local authorities is described as \"almost identical\".\nMr Laws says that it shows it would have been \"rash and dangerous\" to press ahead with forcing all schools to become academies, as it would have meant that some high-achieving local authorities could have been put into lower-achieving academy trusts.\nThe former education minister said that for successive governments there had been a \"lack of political will to show that some academies are not doing well\".\nMr Laws, a former Liberal Democrat MP, said that a \"lot of political capital has been invested\" in presenting academies as the way to raise school standards.\nEducation Secretary Nicky Morgan has had to abandon plans to force all schools to become academies, but Mr Laws says their political protection went back to the early days of the first academies created by Labour governments.\nMr Laws said that they were seen by the government as \"a small and precious flower that people wanted to stamp on\".\nThe comparisons produced by the think tank are based on how much pupils have improved, rather than exam results, as a way of measuring the effectiveness of local authorities and academy trusts.\nMany academies operate as stand-alone schools, so these are not included in the rankings, which compare multi-academy trusts.\nMr Laws said that the findings highlighted the need to find ways to scrutinise and improve weak academy chains - but that did not mean that the principle of academies, with greater autonomy, was flawed.\nBut he suggested that it showed successful local authorities should be able to set up their own academy trusts, rather than have schools taken away from them.\nReport author Jon Andrews also highlighted other factors, such as regional differences. Schools in London are higher performers - and he says that both local authorities and academy trusts are likely to do better if they have schools in the capital.\nThe Sutton Trust education charity has also published a report warning that too many academy trusts are not providing a good enough education for disadvantaged pupils.\nIt says that one in five academy chains is \"performing substantially below the national average for attainment and improvement\" for children from poorer families.\nLizzie Rowe, chief operating officer of the Education Fellowship, the lowest rated primary academy trust, said that trusts needed to be given time to make progress and that this was not always shown in immediate results.\n\"Data enables you to judge the pace and direction of a journey - data is not the journey. Some political powers forget this.\n\"Our strategy is very sound in developing leadership and enabling teachers to deliver outstanding lessons.\n\"Some of the most successful academies started well over a decade ago and were given millions of pounds to get established.

{"document": "They were brutal, inhuman regimes led by men with notorious reputations for violence and suppressing opposition - Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina and so on.\nOne of the great success stories across the region, in the intervening three or four decades, was how most of those dictatorships were driven out - usually by the overwhelming force of peaceful, popular pressure - and were replaced by elected democratic governments.\nThe general consensus among observers, politicians and the Latin American public is that democracy is here to stay.\nThat is certainly the case here in Brazil, a country that has grown into one of the world's top 10 economies, where vigorous political debate is the everyday norm and where, since the return of civilian rule in 1985, the army's place has unquestionably been back in the barracks.\nSo, even in these times of social unrest and economic crisis in Brazil, there is no real threat of military intervention. But many people are describing the removal of the country's first female leader as a coup, albeit one carried out by politicians rather than generals.\nThat is certainly how Dilma Rousseff herself sees things after a vote in the country's senate triggered her dismissal over charges that she illegally manipulated government accounts to hide the scale of the budget deficit.\nFor Ms Rousseff the experience was not as physically painful as the torture and abuse she suffered as a prisoner under the former dictatorship, but she felt just as keenly a sense of injustice and abuse of power.\nDilma Rousseff vigorously denied the charges which in the great scheme of things could be characterised as relatively minor.\nShe has repeatedly described the process as a plot by her political opponents to force her from office, replacing without an election a leftist, socialist government with a centre-right, market-friendly alternative.\nIn other words, say Ms Rousseff and her supporters also believe it was a coup.\nBut if the term \"coup\" describes a sudden and illegal seizure of power, that is arguably not what happened in Brazil.\nDilma Rousseff's removal was a long drawn-out legal affair, overseen by the country's Supreme Court.\nImpeachment is a provision laid out in the Brazilian constitution, as it is in many other democracies. As flimsy or irrelevant as many thought the charges were, the [now] former president was able to defend herself by legal argument and with counsel throughout.\nThe law might be an ass, but it is still the law.\nDilma Rousseff has never been formally accused of corruption or self-enrichment, unlike many of the men who have sat in judgment over her in the Brazilian Congress during the recent turbulent weeks and months.\nNor has she been implicated in the wide-ranging \"car wash\" corruption scandal, involving the payment of billions of dollars in bribes in relation to contracts at the state controlled oil giant, Petrobras.\nSeveral senior politicians, including members of Ms Rousseff's own Workers Party, have been ensnared in the scandal.\nOne widely-held belief is that the overriding concern for Brazil's well-heeled political elite is to find a way of shutting down or, emasculating, the corruption investigation before it goes any deeper.\nFernando Gabeira, once a left-wing senator but who now commentates on Brazilian politics says what has happened is \"good for Brazil\".\n\"The rules were obeyed, the constitution was considered and it means that Brazil's democracy will be stronger than before.\"\nOthers, including Gleisi Hoffman, a former minister in the last Rousseff government disagree.\nShe described the removal of a democratically elected leader as  \"a sordid and lamentable affair\".\nDilma Rousseff's biggest mistake, and perhaps the real reason that she was impeached, was her unwillingness or inability to make the deals and alliances necessary to run an effective government in Brazil's fractured multi-party system.\nHer last two years in office have been plagued by an economy in recession, rising inflation and unemployment.\nBrazilians have become worried that many of the gains made in the first 10 years of Workers Party rule could be lost under her stewardship, in stark contrast to the years of plenty, fuelled by high oil prices, overseen by her more charismatic, politically astute and but perhaps less scrupulous predecessor, President Lula da Silva.\nIn the shape of Ms Rousseff's replacement and former deputy, Michel Temer, Brazil now has a centre-right president who has promised to protect the popular social programmes introduced by the Rousseff/Lula governments.\nBut, vowing to get the country's broken economy back on track, Mr Temer is also looking to cut government budgets and change priorities. It is a familiar conundrum and within an hour of being sworn in, the new leader was flying to China for the G-20 summit.\nBrazilian democracy has been damaged and sullied in the eyes of many by what happened in Brasilia.\nBack-stabbing, betrayal and the ever-present spectre of corruption? Yes.  But a coup?  Probably not.", "summary": "Back in the 1970s, when I first lived in Latin America and was hooked by a fascination for this region that has never left, virtually every country here was ruled by a military dictatorship.", "id": "37271465"}

{"document": "Handing over an envelope containing 50,000 Vietnamese dong (VND) ($2.4, \u00c2\u00a31.6) did not do the trick, but when she added another 50,000 VND, the referral was secured.\nThe 33-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, then gave an envelope containing 500,000 VND ($24, \u00c2\u00a316) to the medical staff at the provincial hospital, an amount that was more than two months of her income.\n\"All other patients told me that everyone must give envelopes to thank the doctors and nurses for the treatment, and that was the rate for such an operation,\" she said.\nThe staff did not ask for it but she believed that by giving the envelope her son would receive better care.\nShe is not alone. Mrs Phin, a pensioner from a Hanoi suburb who lives on 3m VND per month, handed over an envelope containing 200,000 VND after eye treatment in hospital.\nBut she was sent home before the treatment was complete. So she was admitted to hospital again and that meant another thank-you envelope.\n\"It cost me another 200,000 VND to thank the doctors and nurses. I could only afford the smallest amount suggested by other patients,\" she said.\nMrs Luyen, a retired teacher from a small town 35km outside of Hanoi, said passing over a cash gift for medical treatment was effectively mandatory.\n\"Not all doctors ask for the envelopes but giving envelopes is a must when you go to hospital. It's in our culture,\" she said.\nIn Vietnam, medical treatment is mostly subsidised by the state via an insurance system free to civil servants and children, or paid for privately or by employers.\nBut queues for treatment under insurance cover are long and public hospitals overcrowded, while salaries for much of the medical profession remain low.\nAnd with growing capitalist sentiment meeting entrenched Confucian values, the practice of handing over a cash-filled envelope to secure faster or better service has become widespread.\nThe number of people who gave envelopes doubled in the three years from 2007-2010 - from 13% to 29%, one study showed.\nIn 2012, a survey published by the World Bank and Vietnam's Government Inspectorate (which runs the Anti-Corruption Bureau) showed that 76% of those who had paid a bribe to health service personnel did so voluntarily, with only 21% responding to a request.\nIn an effort to fight corruption, five big hospitals in Hanoi launched a campaign in October 2011 to bolster ethical behaviour among staff, including a \"Say no to envelopes\" policy.\nVietnam's Research and Training Centre for Community Development (RTCCD) also conducted a similar campaign to change perceptions of informal payments, using the media to raise patients' awareness of their rights as well as of doctors' duties.\nNguyen Huu Ngoc, a well-known scholar in Hanoi, said the root of the problem lay in the Confucian gift-giving tradition.\n\"In Vietnamese society as well as in Chinese, gifts stem from gratitude,\" the scholar said.\n\"Showing gratitude used to have more spiritual value than material value. But over the years, it has become more material and less spiritual, and now in the market economy it is like a transaction.\"\nCulture might be used to justify the payments - but culture can be changed, according to Soren Davidsen, a senior governance specialist at the World Bank in Hanoi.\n\"We know gift-giving is an important part of culture. But we also know that culture is not a static but dynamic thing. Several countries in East Asia, such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan, have a culture of corruption, yet these countries have found effective ways to curb corruption.\n\"Although there is often the perception about culture being a part of corruption, we think that this is the wrong way of looking at it. And we can, by involving people, businesses and government in partnership, actually change culture,\" said Mr Davidsen.\nFor many people, the line between a gift and a bribe has become blurred - something some people embrace as \"an excuse to give envelopes\", said Tran Thu Ha, vice-director of RTCCD.\nBut for people who campaign to stop the practice like her, it is easy to identify what is a gift and what is a bribe.\n\"A gift can be given in public or anywhere, it needs time to talk and to say thank you, whereas a bribe is often given very quickly and both the giver and the receiver are afraid of being seen by other people,\" Ms Ha said.\nBut to change people's behaviour is one of the big difficulties that Vietnam is facing and will take time, acknowledged Mr Ngo Manh Hung, deputy director-general of Vietnam's Anti-Corruption Bureau.\nThere has been considerable debate about how to curb the practice in the health service. One suggestion is raising health workers' salaries so that they stop accepting envelopes.\nBut that alone will not be enough. Associate Professor Ta Van Binh, director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders, believes that the government needs clear rules and tough punishments for medical staff who break them.\nBut work also needs to be done to help patients understand that they do not need to give envelopes - and may themselves be breaking the rules if they do.\nNguyen Huu Ngoc even thinks that there should be sanctions applied to patients who give envelopes to help clean up the industry.\nBut this would need co-operation from all sides - patients, health workers and the authorities - and remains a big task.\n\"It's not an easy thing to do because corruption is about money, people and power,\" said Mr Davidsen of the World Bank.\n\"It's a huge challenge curbing corruption and co-ordinating anti-corruption efforts across government agencies. It is not a quick fix and can't be done overnight.\"\nThere will be a series of special reports and articles this week as the BBC examines why bribes and backhanders are part of the system in so much of the world, looks at countries which have tried to roll back the tide - and explains how corruption works.", "summary": "Three months ago, a woman from a village south of Hanoi needed her son referred to a provincial hospital by a district doctor for an operation.", "id": "23237285"}
{"document": "One of their own was coming home to be given the freedom of the burgh after achieving what was something akin to the moon landing of its time.\nCaptain James Anderson, by then Sir James Anderson, was in command of the ship which laid a telegraph cable under the Atlantic.\nOn 14 December 1866, his fellow Doonhamers put on a banquet worthy of such a significant achievement.\nThe menu for the 200 invited guests at the Assembly Rooms was of a quality - and scale - reserved for only the most special occasions.\n\"The dinner was plentiful, rich and well diversified,\" reported the Dumfries and Galloway Standard.\n\"The bill of fare including four kinds of soup, as many varieties of fish, a haunch of venison, roasts of beef, braised beef, mutton roast and boiled, pigeon pies, venison pasties, rabbit curries, chicken curries, cutlets, blackgame, grouse, pheasants, woodcocks and many other articles.\n\"A second course followed of puddings, souffles, mince pies, tarts, creams, jellies, blancmanges, trifles and other pastry.\n\"The wines supplied were champagne, hock, port and sherry.\"\nIt crowned an incredible journey for a boy born in south west Scotland with a passion for the sea.\nDumfries and Galloway Council archivist Graham Roberts explained: \"He was born in 1824, he was the son of a bookseller who had a shop on the High Street near the top of the vennel, John Anderson.\n\"He was the fourth son - so he wasn't going to go into the family business.\n\"He had a brief apprenticeship as a printer - he got totally fed up and said he wanted to go to sea.\"\nA passion - and aptitude - for being out on the water had been with him since his time as a schoolboy in the town.\n\"It was when he was at the Academy that he entered the Dumfries regatta but he didn't have a boat,\" explained Mr Roberts.\n\"All he had was a tin tub - which became known as Anderson's canister - and he still won the race.\"\nHis family, somewhat reluctantly, eventually allowed him to join T&J Brocklebank in Whitehaven where his career went from strength to strength.\nHis abilities as a navigator and a leader were quickly recognised.\n\"He shot through the ranks and became a master of a ship in his early 20s and by the 1840s or 1850s he was basically head hunted,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"You didn't go from sail to steam but he did and the steam ships were the biggest.\"\nBefore he reached 40, he was put in charge of the biggest of them all.\n\"In 1862 or 1863 he was head hunted to be captain of the Great Eastern where they were trying to lay the Transatlantic Cable,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"The Great Eastern was five times bigger than any ship there had ever been before that.\n\"It remained the biggest ship until the series of ships which included the Titanic.\n\"When you were captaining that ship it wasn't just a small step up navigationally - it was very hard to manoeuvre it.\"\nAnd yet Anderson seemed to have the skills required.\n\"A lot of people who knew him remarked on his calmness,\" said Mr Roberts.\nBill Burns, who runs the History of the Atlantic Cable and Undersea Communications website, said Anderson was a remarkable individual involved in one of the biggest logistical operations of the day.\n\"After the partial success of the Atlantic cable in 1858, which proved the feasibility of the project, the 1865 and 1866 expeditions were without doubt the most significant events in the industry's history up until that time and for many years to come,\" he said.\n\"The Atlantic cable route, as it remains today with multiple fibre optic lines, was the most important in the world for trade, finance, and government.\"\nMr Burns said the successful completion of the project - which cost the equivalent of $100m in today's money - was the responsibility of Samuel Canning, the engineer in charge of the expedition.\nHowever, he said that Anderson, as the captain, had \"many additional responsibilities\" to ensure the success of the operation, including directing the complex manoeuvring of the ship required when laying and recovering cables at great depth.\n\"Add to that the fact that Anderson was at the helm of the Great Eastern (the largest ship ever built at that time and for many years after), which had already survived many disasters and had bankrupted its owners, and you can understand that he was no ordinary captain,\" he said.\nHis first attempt to lay the cable would test his abilities to the full.\n\"In 1865, everything that could go wrong did go wrong - they actually feared sabotage at the time,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"They were very worried there was some saboteur on board from some rival firm.\"\nThat mission ended in failure, with the cable lost, but the story had gripped the nation.\n\"Because they were laying the cable they could still keep in communication with the mainland and the reports were constantly in the papers,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"When they came back instead of being treated as losers they were treated as heroes.\"\nIt prompted a big effort for a renewed attempt in 1866.\n\"It was world news - it was the first time that a really long cable was being laid under sea,\" said Mr Roberts.\n\"This was far, far bigger than anything before and they had so many challenges.\n\"Everybody knew that if they could do that then the whole world would be linked up.\n\"We had the railway age in the 1840s - this was the big thing, it was really the story of the 1860s in technical terms.\"\nThe tale of the journey from Valentia Island, one of Ireland's most westerly points, to Heart's Content, Newfoundland generated huge interest.\nNot only was the 1866 attempt successful, they were also able to pick up the lost cable from the previous year and complete two telegraph links under the ocean.\nAnderson's part in the mission, the brainchild of American businessman Cyrus Field, brought him both recognition and proved to have a profitable side.\nHe was seen as the ideal person to be a director of a large number of telegraph companies, including the firm that would eventually become Cable and Wireless.\nHe was honoured by Queen Victoria but recognition in his hometown still meant a lot to him.\n\"I should like to let you know, if I only could, how deeply I feel this your kindness,\" he said.\n\"I know very well that as long as my life lasts, I shall remember it, and shall do nothing to forfeit the kindness and praise which you have now bestowed upon me.\"\nAlthough he lived in London by this time, he still had a soft spot for south west Scotland making regular trips back home.\n\"He built the house at Kirkconnel Lea near Glencaple in 1872, that was his fun place,\" said Mr Roberts. \"He also came back to give talks.\"\nHis death, in May 1893, was the subject of a large obituary in the local papers and his body was brought back to Dumfries for burial in St Mary's churchyard.\n\"In his death, Dumfries has to mourn the loss of a distinguished and devoted son,\" wrote the Dumfries and Galloway Standard.\n\"His life-story, moreover, is an instructive illustration of the possibilities that wait on persevering, self-reliant, and intelligently directed effort.\"\nNot bad for a boy who once had to work overtime to save up the money needed to buy a metal \"tub\" to race in a regatta.\nA special display about Sir James Anderson is going up in the archives and local studies section of the Ewart Library in Dumfries starting on Thursday 15 December.", "summary": "The people of Dumfries were in a mood to celebrate 150 years ago.", "id": "38025397"}

Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer.\nIt's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand.\nThey simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum.\nIf it does come that soon, there will be - one predicts - a \"genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites\".\nA stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak.\nA weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam.\nRead more from Ross\nLord Howard played down Mr Duncan Smith's criticisms of government policy - but Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said they were \"very serious\".\n\"Today, when David Cameron stands up, he has to reaffirm the message that led many people like myself to join the Conservative Party in the first place when he became leader,\" she said.\n\"Are we about social justice?

{"document": "Due to travel to Cardiff to pose for photos and answer questions at a Heineken Cup press launch, Saracens told him he had to be at an \"important squad meeting\" in Munich the same day.\nHe complied. Perhaps unsurprisingly considering the \"important squad meeting\" was a day-trip to the city's Oktoberfest beer festival.\nWith the skipper alongside them, the first-team squad made so merry that one of their number failed to make the midnight flight home.\nEuropean rugby officials were not amused, however. They fined Saracens \u00a34,250 for instructing Borthwick to snub Heineken Cup matters for the business of sinking steins.\nWe're trying to be a little bit different, which will always raise eyebrows. Maybe others should look at what we're doing\nSaracens chief executive Edward Griffiths was unapologetic, and Bavaria drinking music pumped out of the speakers before the team's win over Leicester the following weekend.\n\"We're trying to be a little bit different, which will always raise eyebrows,\" he said. \"Maybe others should look at what we're doing.\"\nThis was the autumn of 2010 and Griffiths had been in his job a little over 18 months, having arrived, along with South African director of rugby Brendan Venter, in a series of sweeping changes.\nThe suggestion that Saracens should be the template for others did not seem justified by the north London's club history.\nTrue, they had been denied their first Premiership title the previous season only by a dramatic late Dan Hipkiss try. But for many years Sarries had been a middling club, rarely competitive when the going got tough and rarely threatening to win anything.\nEight months after the Oktoberfest jaunt, they won their first Premiership title.\nThree years further on and they were within two games of a Heineken Cup and Premiership double, facing Toulon and Northampton on successive Saturdays.\nDefeat by the French side on Saturday denied them the first of those, but success in the second remains within their grasp.\nBefore taking up his role with Saracens, Edward Griffiths was chief executive of the South African Rugby Union. He has been credited with ensuring that the 1995 World Cup-winning Springboks side learned all the verses of the new national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, and coming up with the slogan 'one team, one country'.\nThe 'cult of Saracens' - as some have dubbed their way of doing things - is certainly taken seriously now with Griffiths as its charismatic, unorthodox high priest.\nWhile most sports administrators are usually caught between the demands of the balance sheet and the score sheet, he describes himself as merely \"interested\" in the outcome of both finals. And even that sounds like a stretch.\n\"Too much of sport operates under the tyranny of the result,\" Griffiths tells BBC Sport.\n\"The core principle at Saracens is that we gather talented people together, treat them unbelievably well and in return they try unbelievable hard. That is it.\n\"Everything else - winning or losing matches, winning or losing Cups - are just outcomes. They are not the primary aim.\n\"We exist to have a positive impact on as many people as possible.\"\nIt sounds like the philosophy of a smoothie company or perhaps an idealistic Silicon Valley start-up - not the hard-nosed, shape-up-or-ship-out approach of most high-level sport.\nBut it works and Saracens pay much more than lip service to the concept of treating their staff \"unbelievably well\".\nTheir regular foreign jaunts are an obvious part of the process.\nSince 2010 the players have sunned themselves in the Italian resort of Rimini, hung out in Miami, hit the ski slopes in Switzerland and returned to Munich for a longer stay at Oktoberfest - all while their rivals are slogging it out on the training field.\nOne trip involved the players separating into groups to make their way from their Hertfordshire base to a rendezvous in Barcelona by whatever means they chose. On another, they climbed Cape Town's Table Mountain together.\nThis year they went to New York, taking in an ice hockey match at Madison Square Gardens.\nWhile the destinations are exotic, what goes on upon arrival is old-fashioned: no team-building larks, no trust exercises, no flipcharts. Instead, lots of eating, drinking and laughing.\n\"Other clubs look at these trips and think they are stag parties,\" says Griffiths.\n\"It is far from that. It is a carefully-planned process to develop a group of people who will do whatever is necessary for each other and ultimately love each other.\"\nChris Ashton is a recent convert. The England winger, who arrived at Saracens via rugby league side Wigan and Premiership rivals Northampton, says the atmosphere is unlike any other dressing room he has been part of.\n\"When you are at a rugby club every day, you come in, do your work, train and go home to your families,\" he says. \"You don't really get to spend that much quality time as a group together.\n\"Those trips give everyone the opportunity just to get to know everyone a little bit better, and spend quality time together.\"\nSaracens' interpretation of quality time is different from what Ashton had experienced before. It is not just a question of banter. In fact, it isn't really banter at all.\nA natural extrovert, Ashton had a reputation at Northampton - and still has one with England - for being one of the loudest members of the dressing room.\nAt Saracens, however, humility is prized as one of the club's four key values and Ashton has reined in his boisterous, bantering instincts.\n\"When I was at Northampton I was in the middle of it, giving all the abuse out, but that is not a big part of what goes on here,\" he tells BBC Sport.\n\"It's a bit hard to explain, but the environment is different and how the group want to be treated is different.\"\nWithin the Saracens staff there are 29 undergraduate degrees, 11 Masters degrees, one doctorate, two doctors and a professor. Brad Barritt (above) is soon to complete a Masters in business administration.\nThe globe-trotting mini-breaks are only the most eye-catching part of an approach that is designed to care for people as well as players.\nThe club require all their players to develop themselves off the pitch - through studying, work experience or running their own business - to prepare for life after rugby.\nSo centre Brad Barritt is about to complete a Masters in business administration, full-back Alex Goode has donned a shirt and tie to see how the insurance industry works and prop James Johnston's fledgling pie company is open for business at half-time at Allianz Park.\nEvery month on a Tuesday lunchtime, a speaker - after an introduction by a nervous young academy player - talks to the club as a whole.\nFormer England cricket captain Andrew Strauss, Formula 1 legend Sir Jackie Stewart and transatlantic rower Debra Searle are among those to appear at Saracens' St Albans training ground.\nThere are workshops to learn negotiating and networking skills, charity partnerships and social events for players' partners and creches and personalised Christmas gifts for their children.\nPaul Gustard was a player at the club before the arrival of Griffiths and Venter and has remained as defence coach.\n\"To a man, we have changed as people. Not only have we become a better rugby side, but we have become better people,\" he says.\n\"Nobody really comes to Saracens and leaves two years later like they did in the old days. They come here, play their career, retire and move on with a job we've helped them get.\n\"If you can have something that is over and above being a team-mate and be a genuine friend that I can ring up in 10 years' time, that is what I think Saracens is about.\"\nThe inevitable internal competition among a stellar squad could derail all these good intentions.\nBut each player is subjected to four separate psychological profiles. The results are shared with coaches and senior players, so instructions and advice can be delivered in the most constructive way possible.\nBefore taking up residence at their purpose-built Allianz Park home in 2012, Saracens had lead a nomadic existence, playing out of various London venues:\nNobody is ever \"dropped\", they are \"rotated\".\nIt may sound like semantics, but scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth won his starting place in Saracens' last Premiership final appearance only on a coin toss, with Neil de Kock replacing him in the 50th minute regardless of the state of the game.\nReducing results to a secondary concern and caring for, as well as paying, players requires healthy finances and a solid grounding towards the top of the Premiership table.\nBut Saracens have been well-backed before. Former owner Nigel Wray, who remains chairman of the club, brought in World Cup winners Francois Pienaar and Michael Lynagh and French stars Thomas Castaignede and Thierry Lacroix on big contracts.\nThe 1998 Tetley's Bitter Cup was the only silverware to follow.\nNow Saracens are regular challengers for silverware, Griffiths and his staff are aware how their approach may come across.\n\"The Saracens way is our way and it suits us, but we are not pious and preaching about it in any way at all,\" says Griffiths.\n\"I would never tell Leicester, Harlequins or Northampton how to run their clubs.\"\nHe doesn't need to. Players and coaches at all three clubs cannot fail to have been impressed by Saracens' record-breaking 46-6 Heineken Cup semi-final win over Clermont Auvergne.\nGriffiths says: \"The dividing line between success and failure in professional sport is incredibly thin; it is literally a matter of inches.\n\"If you get to know someone well - their wife, their children, what excites them, what concerns them - when you are defending your line in the last minute the bond between you and the man outside you is going to be stronger.\n\"If we can find an extra inch in that bond, in the depth that players are prepared to go for each other, in Miami, New York or anywhere else, that is where we will go.\"", "summary": "Steve Borthwick was double booked.", "id": "27536258"}
{"document": "Both teams had a man sent off - the Terrors' Lewish Toshney, and solitary goalscorer Jason Cummings who picked up two yellow cards apiece at Tannadice.\nCummings volleyed in the only goal after 38 minutes, shortly after Toshney's dismissal.\nBut his 75th-minute sending off for punching the ball into the United net made for a nervous finale for Hibs.\nNeil Lennon's side extended their lead at the Championship summit to nine points, ahead of second placed Falkirk, who play Ayr United on Saturday. Ray McKinnon's United are 10 points adrift in third place, having played a game fewer than Hibs.\nClearly, the home side had to start on the front foot and pressure their opponents. With games running out they really had to win to close the gap the Easter Road side.\nUnited's eagerness to play at pace and be in Hibs' faces ultimately cost them, epitomised by Toshney's rashness.\nThe right-back was lucky to escape one early reckless challenge, but was correctly punished for another on Andrew Shinnie, and when he clattered the midfielder once again, it was a simple decision for referee Don Robertson.\nHibs quickly asserted themselves by going in front and it became too big a task despite Cummings' offer of assistance.\nUnited didn't lack fight. They lacked composure and quality on the night. A first home defeat this season was badly timed.\nThey're not entirely out of the title race, but the smart money would be on a play-off place for the Tannadice side.\nHead coach Lennon might not admit it but few will back anyone other than Hibernian to take the Championship title now.\nCummings' fabulous first-half finish was timely, not too long after Toshney's red card.\nThe striker stole in behind a defence that seemed intent on playing a high line. Shinnie exposed that with a lovely lofted ball into Cummings' path and he made no mistake with a vital, instinctive goal.\nCummings was also unlucky to be flagged offside when clean through and might have earned a penalty when William Edjenguele appeared to catch him near the goalline just before half-time.\nIt was the 21-year-old's 20th goal of the season - great work from him all-round, until later.\nMartin Boyle should have ended the contest when he had time, and space six yards out, but volleyed wildly over.\nThe impressive Shinnie thought he had sealed the win after great work from Boyle, only for Cammy Bell to parry his shot over the bar.\nHibs rarely looked troubled with goalkeeper Ofir Marciano a virtual spectator.\nThis was a massive step for Lennon's men, and with three home games to follow, they are very much on track for the top flight.\nFor all his positives, Cummings risked this win with few minutes of madness. He was unnecessarily booked for throwing the ball away when ruled offside.\nMinutes later he threw himself at a cross, blatantly punched the ball in the net and was correctly ordered off.\nIt was utter madness and offered United a lifeline from nowhere. Luckily for him, his team mates saw it through.\nIn total, 10 players were booked, and Lennon was ordered to the stand late on. However, Hibs got the job done, and deserved to finish with three valuable points.\nDundee United manager Ray McKinnon: \"It was extremely difficult when we went down to 10 men.\n\"I thought we started the game excellently and controlled the first 15 minutes, but the sending-off certainly had a massive impact on the game.\n\"I haven't seen it again, but Lewis has gone for the ball and then he has pulled out. It was clear for everybody on our bench.\n\"The ref is entitled to make that decision, but we were very disappointed. You have to look at all the decisions that were made and some of inconsistencies and tackles that went unpunished.\n\"But what is important is what we do from now until the end of the season and focus on winning every game.\n\"I thought we showed great character to battle back hard with 10 men. We will take the positives out of that and fight for every point until the end and see where we end up.\"\nHibernian head coach Neil Lennon: \"Jason's got to learn to control his temper.\n\"I've been there - I got many a telling off from Martin O'Neill in my younger days - but he's an outstanding talent and he's come up with a really big goal in a big game and he does it consistently and it's not a coincidence.\n\"We were outstanding. The only disappointment was the sending off really, which put us on the back foot for 10 minutes.\n\"The rest of the game, we played really strongly and we looked a very good side. Thoroughly deserved to win.\n\"I wanted them to put down a marker for the rest of the season and hopefully they've done that.\n\"It is a difficult place to come and win, but I thought we were head and shoulders above Dundee United.\n\"I underplayed it this week, but it is probably the biggest game we've had league wise for two or three seasons and they've responded brilliantly.\"\nMatch ends, Dundee United 0, Hibernian 1.\nSecond Half ends, Dundee United 0, Hibernian 1.\nFoul by John McGinn (Hibernian).\nPaul Dixon (Dundee United) wins a free kick on the right wing.\nBrian Graham (Hibernian) wins a free kick in the defensive half.\nFoul by Willo Flood (Dundee United).\nHand ball by Willo Flood (Dundee United).\nJordan Forster (Hibernian) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.\nFoul by Jordan Forster (Hibernian).\nMark Durnan (Dundee United) wins a free kick on the right wing.\nSubstitution, Hibernian.

But I don't care, it's my first defence. I'm shy, so I've gotta have something. I need some protection, man.\"\nIn 2006, she made a semi-legendary appearance at the music industry festival SXSW, triggering a record label bidding war.\nAmong her suitors was American Idol judge and all-round big cheese LA Reid, who signed her to Island Records - but their relationship quickly soured. (LP later accused Island of \"taking a little tomboy and putting her in a dress\").\nTo her horror, the pattern was repeated over and over again.\n\"I've had so many record deals now. I'm like on my seventh one. I've had so many chats about how much money I was going to make, it's shocking.\"\n\"Three or four record deals in, it feels like life has smacked you in the face.\"\nIncredibly, she doesn't hold any grudges, taking a philosophical view of her \"'quote-unquote 'failures'\".\n\"Trying to launch a career as an artist is like trying to run through a crowd holding hands with five people. It's so difficult.\"\nBy 2007, she'd given up on the idea of solo success, becoming a professional songwriter after one of her Island rejects, Love Will Keep You Up All Night, ended up on a Backstreet Boys album.\nHer big breakthrough came when she contributed to Rihanna's hit single Cheers (Drink To That), a dizzy, Jameson-swilling party anthem from the star's Loud album.\nIncredibly, LP claims to have bashed out the song on a \"cheap Hawaiian-brand ukulele\" she'd brought along to the studio on a whim.\n\"It's a nice, off-the-cuff thing to bring to a session,\" she explains. \"It's a little more organic. After we were done writing melodies, I could sit in the corner and write words with it, you know?\"\nShe's since adopted the ukulele as her signature instrument - she even has her own, custom-made model from uke legends CF Martin & Company.\n\"Unknowingly, the ukulele started to worm its way into my heart,\" she says.\n\"I would sit in bed with it and whistle these little melodies. It was like, 'Wow, I love this. Maybe I should make it into a song?'\"\n\"And that's where my trajectory of becoming an artist again came from. It was like me working my way back to enjoying music again.\"\nBut the main catalyst for her new material was a painful break-up with her girlfriend of five years. Lost On You is a primal howl, lamenting all the time she wasted on the relationship.\n\"Let's raise a glass or two / To all the things I've lost on you,\" sings LP.\n\"When I wrote that song, I was still about a year away from the breakup,\" she says. \"It was like a long, winding, circle-the-drain situation.\"\nThe beginning of the end came when her partner asked to have an open relationship.\n\"The thing that upset me most was I knew she could see that I didn't want to go along with it.  But I tried it because I was really in love with her.\"\nA couple of months into the experiment, though, LP fell for someone else. Hard.\n\"I was like, 'oops, I just fell in love with someone else'.

I'm still with that woman a year and a half later.\"\n\"It's a happy ending - but also with some scars and some baggage, for sure.\"\nLP's new girlfriend - musician Lauren Ruth Ward -  even appears at the end of the video for Lost On You, which the singer describes as a cautionary tale.\n\"That story is something you definitely don't want to hear if you're the person that decides to have an open relationship,\" she laughs.\nIt's easy to see why Lost On You has connected with so many people. LP sings with unfiltered angst about trying to wake up a lover who's lost interest; while the song's spaghetti-western arrangement betrays the hopelessness of the situation.\nLike the lonesome cowboy she is, LP whistles throughout the track - sorrowfully echoing the hook and, at one point, apparently hailing a cab.\n\"I have a bunch of whistles I can do,\" she laughs, \"and we were like, 'let's take my whistling to another level!'\"\nIt's not very fashionable, though, is it? The last great whistling song was Peter, Bjorn and John's Young Folks 11 years ago, and it's not like people were gagging for a sequel.\n\"I feel good about whistling,\" protests LP. \"A lot of people don't get it [but] I use it as an instrument.\n\"I do two things that are normally super-gimmicky, that I refuse to accept as gimmicks in my music: ukulele and whistling.\n\"I just use them unabashedly.

{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nNow, he has to find a replacement for the German as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton. And at this late stage of the year, it will be no easy task.\nSo who will be on Wolff's shortlist and how likely are they to get the seat?\nThis is the fight many would like to see. Hamilton and Alonso are regarded as the two towering talents of their generation and their intense battle as McLaren team-mates in 2007 was cut short by Alonso falling out with boss Ron Dennis and leaving the team. They ended that year tied on points, one behind world champion Kimi Raikkonen, with four wins each.\nRound two would be the biggest box office F1 could hope for, but it is highly unlikely to happen for two reasons: 1) Alonso is under contract to McLaren and even if he has a break clause - which they say he does not - they would not want to let him go; 2) More importantly, Wolff knows that the problems he had with Hamilton and Rosberg would pale compared to the potential difficulties of handling Hamilton and Alonso.\nChances of it happening: 6/10\nThe Australian was the choice of many observers as the driver of 2016, and Wolff is a big fan. The on-track battle with Hamilton would be intense, but Ricciardo is a laid-back character and would probably be easier to handle off it.\nBut he is under contract to Red Bull until 2018. Red Bull says they have no intention of letting him go, but if Wolff approached them there is just the possibility that they may consider selling Ricciardo. Why? Because most accept that, long term, Ricciardo and Max Verstappen is not a sustainable line-up - if Red Bull become title contenders their relationship is very likely to become incendiary.\nChances: 6/10\nVerstappen is the big rising star of F1. Shaded by Ricciardo over 2016 as a whole, performances such as his stunning drive in the wet in Brazil last month mark him out as a future world champion.\nWolff would be very interested but, like Ricciardo, Verstappen is under contract to Red Bull - in his case to the end of 2019. And Red Bull are even more in love with the Dutchman than they are with Ricciardo.\nChances: 4/10\nVettel's love affair with Ferrari - and vice versa - is long over after a difficult and disappointing season. Relations with team boss Maurizio Arrivabene are frayed - especially since the Italian said the four-time champion should focus more on his driving and needed to \"earn\" a new contract beyond 2017. And Vettel was unhappy with the decision to split with technical director James Allison in the summer.\nLikewise, Ferrari have been confused how, after a year and a half of easily beating team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, Vettel's form slipped in the second half of 2016 - although they might want to read the previous paragraph for an answer.\nVettel has been shopping around for a move and would almost certainly welcome a switch to Mercedes. But there are some problems: 1) his contract runs to the end of 2017 and there is no obvious replacement for Ferrari; 2) he might not fancy going up against Hamilton; 3) Vettel and Hamilton together is almost as much of a recipe for trouble as Hamilton and Alonso.\nChances of it happening: 8/10\nWolff has a long relationship with Bottas as part of his management team and rates him highly. The Finn has impressed in the last four seasons with Williams and would be a low-maintenance choice. He would deliver solid results on track and is calm and would not rock the boat off it.\nNext year is the last year of his contract at Williams. The team is not the most flush with cash in the pit lane and Wolff would almost certainly be able to put together an attractive deal - either for a cash payment to release Bottas or a reduction in Williams' engine fee.\nBut Williams have an 18-year-old rookie in the well-resourced Canadian Lance Stroll in their other car next year and need experience in the lead car. Wolff could offer them Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein, who raced for Manor in 2016, in exchange. But would Williams accept?

But he has only one season's race experience, and although he has put in some promising drives, he has had a few shaky ones as well.\nPutting him in a race-winning car with Hamilton as his team-mate would be a big ask. And that's without even considering his personality. Insiders say Wehrlein can be difficult and self-centred, and Wolff will be wary of putting such a character alongside Hamilton.\nChances: 8/10\nAnother Mercedes young driver, Ocon has impressed in his half-season alongside Wehrlein at Manor - so much so that Force India picked him rather than the German as their second driver alongside Sergio Perez for 2017.\nBut Ocon has only nine races under his belt and it's surely too early for him to get a seat at the factory Mercedes team.\nChances: 7/10\nA left-field choice, the Scot has been out of F1 for two years now. But he was Williams reserve driver this year and is a Mercedes-contracted driver in the DTM German Touring Car Championship and would be a solid option.\nChances: 5/10\nButton has retired from F1, but remains contracted to McLaren. He made it very clear in the last few weeks that he needed a break from the sport.\nChances: 1/10\nThe German has just signed a three-year deal with Renault, but the French company and Mercedes have links on a corporate level and Wolff is close friends with their racing boss Frederic Vasseur.\nBut taking Hulkenberg would leave Renault with a vacancy that would be tough to fill and Wolff is not overly enamoured with him either.\nChances: 2/10", "summary": "Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff admits that Nico Rosberg's decision to retire took him completely by surprise - but it is only the start of his problems.", "id": "38185491"}
{"document": "In part the answer might be that they are not as solid as we have been led to believe. After all, the man who headed an inquiry into the future safety of Britain's banks has told the BBC that plans drawn up by the Bank of England to prevent another crash, aren't strong enough.\nSir John Vickers, who led the Independent Commission on Banking, said that banks should have more money in reserve, to enable them to survive any future financial crisis without a bailout from the taxpayer.\nWith banking shares already being hard hit this year because of worries about their strength and stability those comments by Sir John will be of serious concern and will add to what many will see as logical scepticism.\nBefore the last financial crisis, we were told that the banking system was solid as a rock. Unfortunately, Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers proved that the Bible is right - even the most solid looking house is vulnerable if it is built on sand. It turned out that a large number of the world's banks were built on very soft and shifting sand.\nThey had borrowed money short term and lent it long term. They had lent it to clients who couldn't afford to pay it back and put it into risky complicated investments they didn't really understand. It then turned out that the banks had nothing like enough reserves to cushion them from a crisis. They managed to do all this while convincing us that financial services were the future and bankers should be paid a fortune.\nThe consequence was that the ordinary tax payer, many of whom have probably never had a bonus in their life, had to bail out the banks and the bankers with hundreds of billions of pounds, most of it borrowed. That has hobbled us with huge debts for decades to come; while suffering the worst recession in living memory.\nBut perhaps the people who suffered the biggest loses were those who had put their life savings into supposedly safe as houses banking shares, they saw their money wiped out. The depositors were saved by the Government, the people who had lent money to banks in the form of bonds mostly got their money back but the shareholders suffered.\nIt is therefore hardly surprising that shares in banks should be so volatile at the moment. After all, we have received numerous warnings that something is seriously wrong with the world's economy. The price of oil and that of many other commodities have plummeted because of over supply and lack of demand, the Chinese economy is slowing down dramatically and the eurozone still has real problems.\nAll this while many economies are still being propped up only by emergency medicine eight years after the crisis first started, very low interest rates, the printing of extra money and huge Government borrowing.\nLast week Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, spooked the markets when she merely suggested that although the American economy was doing well it could be threatened by problems from other countries.\nIt has all been enough to push share prices lower on fears that another economic crisis might be on the way and like a particularly expensive game of pass the parcel no one wants to be left holding bank shares if, or when, the banks go bust again. But how likely is that?\nSome banks are, of course, stronger than others, the Greek banking system has lurched from crisis to crisis even over the last year and doubtless there are others in similar difficulties in plenty of other places.\nIt would be a brave (as in foolhardy) investor who put their life savings into Greek or even Portuguese bank shares. But those are known risks. The big worry is; how risky are the big international banks? Are the huge international Swiss, British, French, German, American and Japanese banks safe?\nIn theory the answer is yes. The banks have been told to get their house in order and have been doing just that, especially under something called Basle 3, an international agreement to massively increase the reserves the banks have to hold in case of losses or a massive economic shock.\nThen there has been a whole rash of new banking regulations at the national and international levels, designed to stamp out reckless behaviour, limit risks, and make sure that the regulators know what is really going on.\nHaving covered a few fraud trials recently, it is patently clear that before the crash many banks and bankers treated both regulators and their internal compliance departments with barely concealed contempt and did all they could to get round the rules.\nThat may still be the case in some banks but you are far less likely to get away with it now. Finally the banks have been desperately trying to improve their balance sheets and profits, they have had to write off billions in bad debts, improve their lending practices and concentrate on core businesses rather than obscure financial instruments.\nEven so many are still trying to recover from the trauma of the credit crunch. Only this week Commerzbank, one of Germany's largest  banks, announced that it was setting even more money aside to bolster its reserves.\nAnd Deutsche Bank said it is to buy back bonds it has issued, an attempt to strengthen bolster its balance sheet, its shares are down almost a third so far this year. Given the current stock market mood those are probably wise moves. But it show that eight years after the credit crunch there is still more to be done.\nThere are doubtless plenty of banks out there that are as solid as a rock and capable of withstanding almost anything thrown at them. The problem is not so much finding out which ones they are but the fact that last time they all looked solid as a rock as well.\nYou can reform, regulate and prop up banks as much as you like, but shareholders should remember the old motto: \"Once bitten, twice shy.\"", "summary": "If, as we are constantly being told, the world's banking system has been rebuilt and strengthened so that it can resist and survive even the toughest of economic conditions, why does it always seem to be banking shares that fall the most when the markets get nervous about the prospects of another crash?", "id": "35559861"}
{"document": "In 2012, we've swung from droughts to floods, hot to cold.\nThe impact has been felt far and wide, not least by the UK's burgeoning wine industry.\nWith over 400 acres of vineyards in Hampshire and Sussex, Nyetimber grows the same variety of grapes that are found in the Champagne region in France.\nThe company has been working to put English sparkling wine on the map, but this year it hasn't had much to celebrate.\n\"Nyetimber's [vines] have been planted since 1988, and 2012 is the first year we said there is no way we can make wine,\" says Cherie Spriggs, a wine-maker at the company.\nTorrential rain and cool temperatures meant their grapes were not up to standard.\n\"It came to early October, and we were evaluating the fruit and tasting it, and we just said this isn't going to happen.\n\"The quality of the fruit was just not at the level that we needed in order to make sparkling wine at the quality we are striving for.\"\nCancelling the harvest, she says, felt like a kick in the stomach.\n'Erratic excursions'\nThe culprit for much of the extreme weather that the UK has seen this year is the jet stream.\nUsually, this river of air in our upper atmosphere flows in a fairly straight line from the east coast of America, east across the Atlantic.\nIt fluctuates a little all the time, but this year, it underwent large variations and then got locked in these unusual patterns.\nTim Palmer, professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford, explains: \"When the jet stream moves up to the north, and then travels back down to the UK, it brings with it cold air, blizzards, very severe and unpleasant weather from that perspective.\n\"On the other hand, when the jet stream moves south, then we get these periods of intense flooding, which we have seen through the second part of this year.\"\nBut Professor Palmer says that with climate change, the jet stream could become far more variable.\nHe says: \"The question of how it will change is still a very active research problem, and we don't have clear-cut answers yet.\n\"But I think there is quite a big possibility that what we will see is the jet stream undergoing quite dramatic and erratic excursions.\"\nAnd the UK's geographical position under the jet stream means that we could see the worst of this.\nProf Palmer explains: \"I think it is a bit unwise, and possibly even a bit dangerous, to think that the climate of the UK will just gradually warm and we'll transition to a more balmy southern European climate.\n\"If the ideas about a more fluctuating jet stream are correct, then in fact what we will be seeing is a climate with many more extremes: both extremes of wetness and flooding on the one hand, and extremes and dryness and possibly even coldness on the other.\"\nGetting prepared\nThe exact course that the UK's climate will take is still uncertain, and scientists say we need more powerful computers and better climate models to improve how we predict our future weather.\nDespite this, the Environment Agency is starting to prepare for a change in our weather patterns.\nFlooding is a particular concern, and the agency has been working to put more early flood warnings and flood defences in place.\nLord Chris Smith, the chairman of the Environment Agency, says: \"If you think back to the major flooding in the summer of 2007, not only were there a large number of properties affected by the flooding, there were also some key bits of infrastructure - electricity substations and water treatment plants, which were serious threatened.\n\"We've been trying to make sure over the period since then that our infrastructure is better protected.\"\nOther industries, such as agriculture, also need to start planning ahead, says Professor Monique Simmonds from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew.\nIn their glasshouses, scientists at Kew are looking at a variety of crops from around the world that could potentially survive a more changeable climate in the UK.\n\"If you look at other parts of the world where you have droughts, for example, there are a lot of your mints, thymes, rosemarys that actually do quite well under warmer and drier conditions,\" she says.\nNatural solution\nBut, says Prof Simmonds, it's also worth taking a look closer to home.\n\"With the UK, I think one of the things we really need to do is to go back and look at some of our old varieties of crops. To go back, look for some traits associated with possible drought tolerance, or other extremes of conditions, and that can be your barleys, your oats, your peas,\" she explains.\n\"We might have the solutions within those collections.\"\nBut finding a plant that can cope with every kind of weather won't be easy.\n\"It would be difficult to come up with an ideal plant that is able to tolerate drought and then tolerate very, very heavy rain and flooding,\" she says.\n\"Out there in nature there is likely to be some kind of solution - the trick is to be able to identify it.\"\nBack at Nyetimber, and Cherie Spriggs hopes the cancelled harvest won't set them back too much.\nHowever, as they get ready for 2013, they are preparing for more turbulent times ahead.\nShe says: \"We often talk about an average year, but in fact I've never seen an average year. It is always different on every single occasion.\n\"If we try to change everything according to what we have seen this year, Murphy's Law, I will be completely wrong for next year.\"", "summary": "We're always accused of being obsessed with the weather in the UK - but this year we've had a good excuse.", "id": "20803992"}
{"document": "Yet while such a prospect would make most of us run a mile, this is in fact a traditional massage method in Russia.\nCalled a \"venik\" massage, the oak bunches are first softened in warm water. And rather than being whacked on your back in anger, they are gently and rhythmically applied.\nIt is a popular treatment in the thousands of steam bathhouses, or \"banyas\", across Russia.\nThe massage, which takes place in a sauna room set at a temperature of 70C, is said to boost circulation and prevent premature ageing of the skin.\nAnd after the treatment has finished you are supposed to immediately jump into a plunge pool of cold water.\nYou might think that such an unusual massage would struggle to be successfully exported from Russia, but the co-founder of the first banya in London says that two years after opening, almost half of its customers are non-Russians.\nLaunching the banya, called Banya No.1, was the dream of entrepreneurial Russian ex-pat Ksenia Bobkova.\nThe 37-year-old has lived in the UK for more than 20 years after moving from St Petersburg to study law at Edinburgh University in 1994.\nAfter graduating from Edinburgh she has had a successful career in finance in London, first working at a large commercial law firm, and then co-founding a new investment company.\nYet as much as Ms Bobkova says she has always enjoyed living in the UK, the one thing she really missed was regular trips to a banya.\nAfter dreaming of opening London's first banya for more than a decade, Ms Bobkova says that in 2012 \"the circumstances came together\" to enable her to finally start work on it.\nFirstly, she realised that more and more Russians were now living in London, which she hoped would make a banya commercially viable, and she had built up enough savings to launch the business.\nThen she found the right building, and two other UK-based Russian investors came on board.\nAfter a year of construction work, including importing a traditional banya stove from Russia, the bathhouse opened its doors in 2013.\n\"When we wrote the business plan, we certainly focused on the fact that the Russian-speaking community in London had grown substantially over the past 15 years,\" she says.\n\"But after we opened we soon discovered that London is so international, and that people who live here are so open to new experiences, that almost half our customers are non-Russian.\"\nCustomers - both male and female - who don't want to strip naked can instead wear their swimming costume, or a strategically placed towel. And for people who wish to avoid the oak leaves, Scandinavian-style, hands-based back massages are also available.\nAfter the massages, people are encouraged to stay and relax in a lounge or rest area, where they can order traditional Russian food.\nWhile Ms Bobkova is reluctant to discuss how financially successful the banya is, it is often full, and typical visits cost \u00c2\u00a3100 per person. And she now plans to open more branches.\nRunning the banya is a world apart from Ms Bobkova's main job of helping to lead investment firm Fusion Asset Management, of which she was a founding partner in 2004.\nThe business invests millions of pounds globally on behalf of large institutions, and has a sister office in Moscow.\nWhile the original six founders included one Englishman, an American and a Frenchman, it is now owned and run by three London-based Russian ex-pats.\nMs Bobkova says that she likes working in the UK, because she values what she describes as \"British fair play\" in business.\n\"Without comparing specifically to Russia, what is very fundamental in British business ethics is this concept of fair play,\" she says.\n\"[Doing business in the UK means] you can trust people, and people will generally not try to squeeze you too much. In the UK both sides get a fairly allocated share of the profit, rather than one gets all, and the other gets nothing.\"\nIn terms of her day-to-day style as a boss she says that while she has high expectations of staff, it is a point of principle that the 20 people at the finance firm don't have to work late nights or at weekends.\n\"Nothing in the world is so important that it needs to be done at the weekend,\" she says.\nIn addition to the two businesses, Ms Bobkova is also a co-founder of a networking organisation for Russians living and working in London.\nCalled Russians in the City, and with 2,300 members, it holds quarterly events, such as drinks parties, or polo matches and skiing trips.\nThe world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015?\nA Richer World 2015\nListen to the reports and documentaries\nThe organisation has since opened a sister branch in Switzerland, with other ones due to open in New York and Dubai.\nA UK passport holder, and previously married to a British husband, Ms Bobkova says that Russians in the City allow her to maintain the Russian side of her identity.\n\"I'm British in that I have lived here for 20 years, but I'm also obviously Russian,\" she says.\n\"There are different categories of immigrants. Some are so integrated that they almost deny where they came from, while at the other end, some people don't integrate at all.\n\"I'm somewhere in the middle, I'm fully integrated, I went to a British university...

Sometimes you need to run at people rather than around them - you need to put a bit of manners on them.\"\nFoley - or Axel to his mates - died suddenly on Sunday in Paris and the game in Ireland, and beyond, is going to take some time to try to comprehend this outrageous loss.\nWhen the news broke you thought of his family, of course. You thought of all those people at his beloved Shannon RFC, where it all started for him. You thought of his legion of fans at Munster, who hold him up as one of their greatest and most influential sons.\nThe numbers of his playing career are impressive - 201 appearances for Munster and 62 Tests for his country, 86 European ties, three European finals, three semi-finals.\nNo list of his accomplishments would be complete without cataloguing the five All Ireland League titles he won with Shannon. Those victories meant as much to him as anything. Hard rugby played in front of passionate rugby people. This was where Foley was at his happiest. It was what Foley was born to do.\nAnd yet the number that jumped out at you on this grim day was 42 - his age. It's no age.\nHe had taken his first steps in coaching with Munster - he was head coach and in Paris for Munster's opening fixture of the Champions Cup against Racing 92 - and though he had a lot to learn, the story of his playing career told you emphatically that one day he would learn it all and achieve greatness as a coach, too.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nTen years ago he wrote: \"If I'm going to be remembered I'd like to be seen as a stubborn player, somebody who wouldn't give in. There were times during my career when I could have called it quits and gone off and done other things - but there was always a goal there, always something to achieve.\n\"Once there's something to chase, I'll chase it.\"\nFoley underplayed his ability. For sure, he was a stubborn back-row forward, a number eight that would never take a backward step for anybody. But he was intelligent. His reading of rugby games was extraordinary at times.\n\"The smartest rugby player I have ever had the honour of playing with or against,\" said Keith Wood, the former Ireland captain and Foley's boyhood friend.\nIt was easy to see where Foley got it from. He was born into a rugby family - or more particularly, a Shannon family.\nShannon people will tell you there's a difference. They'll say there's no rugby family is like a Shannon rugby family - and therein lies the beauty of rugby in Limerick because Young Munster people say the same thing about themselves, as do those in Garryowen, Old Crescent, Bohemians and many other clubs in this rugby-mad city.\nFoley loved the intercity rivalry. It was bred into him.\nLong before he brought his uncompromising will to the Shannon and Munster dressing room, his father had done it already.\nBrendan Foley did not have a lot as a kid, but what he had was a devotion to the game, a hunger to become good at it and an ability to pass on its joys to his son and daughter, Rosie, who won 39 caps for the Ireland women's team.\n\"As a small boy I was sent to games with him,\" Foley recalled. \"I carried his bag into the changing room at Thomond Park [Shannon's and Munster's home ground] and I minded the spot where he used to tog out - I was very protective of it.\"\nWhen Foley started playing for Munster in October 1994, he sat in the same spot where his father had sat.\nHe excelled. He was never the quickest or most athletic back-row forward - far from it - but he had, in Wood's words, \"a sixth sense, an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time\".\nHe flitted in and out of the Ireland team over the years, a succession of coaches unappreciative of his qualities. In Munster, they loved him unconditionally.\nHis leadership was legendary. When Munster suffered a setback he'd tell his team-mates to stick the memory of the loss into what he called the \"bitterness bank\". He used bitterness in a big way. They still use it now at Thomond Park.\nAt the beginning of the European Cup in 1995, Munster were an irrelevance. Their form in their bear pit in the middle of Limerick tended to be thunderous and many big wins were achieved, but there was no consistency, no apparent hope of them achieving anything.\nThe Foleys and the Mick Galweys and the Peter Clohessys - the Munster totems - drove the team forward. Foley instilled his principles into the new wave - Alan Quinlan, David Wallace, Ronan O'Gara, Peter Stringer, John Hayes, Paul O'Connell, Donncha O'Callaghan.\nA team in Foley's own image had been created.\nMunster made the Heineken Cup final in 2000 and 2002, losing both. They made the semi-finals in 2001, 2003 and 2004 and lost them, too. People in the province wondered if they would ever achieve their ultimate goal.\nFoley never wondered or never had thoughts of surrender. He drove on, as honest and ferocious as ever.\nIn the 2006 Heineken Cup final he captained the team to victory against Biarritz at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and wrote his name in Munster history just as his father did when playing in the side that beat the All Blacks at Thomond Park 28 years earlier in the most storied Irish rugby game of them all.\nHis loss is profoundly shocking.

I'm not from that time period so I don't really think about it that way. I only think about now. What's going to benefit me.\"\nConsett has never had a Conservative MP but the Tory vote held up surprisingly well in other parts of the North-East while Thatcher was in power. In 1983, the party took 34% of North East votes, and had five MPs.\nIt was only after she left office that anti-Tory attitudes really hardened, with the party's share of the vote slumping by 10%. It currently has just three MPs in the region.\nTheresa May is attempting to change that on 8 June and has urged traditional Labour supporters to \"lend\" her their vote.\nShe will have experienced at first hand how difficult it is to break the voting habits of a lifetime in this part of the world when she stood for election in North West Durham in 1992.\n(By a strange coincidence, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was also standing for Parliament for the first time that year in the same constituency.)\nThey still remember Mrs May at Consett Working Men's Club - because, claims the barman, they wouldn't let her through the door.\nIt had nothing to do with her politics, he adds, it's just that the club is one of a tiny handful left in the UK that does not admit women.\n\"Your wife can't chase you in here,\" says one regular, looking up from his racing form. He doesn't want to talk about politics.\nMrs May won 28% of the vote in North West Durham - a score that has not been beaten by a Conservative candidate there since - but although one local poll put the party in with a chance of winning on 8 June it is not high on their target list.\nThere was certainly little enthusiasm for Mrs May's brand of Conservatism in the town's Steel Club, although the lifelong Labour voters I spoke to were equally scathing about their traditional party of choice.\n\"I don't like Jeremy Corbyn. He hasn't got a brain in his head as far as I'm concerned,\" said Christopher Bell, a 69-year-old retired steel worker and club steward.\nHe and his partner, Linda, voted for Brexit in last year's referendum and are worried about the strain they say is being placed on local services by East European immigrants.\nLinda, who voted UKIP in 2015, said she would not return to the Labour fold until the party was led by \"somebody that's going to stand up for English people, working class people - because the Conservatives like the rich and they like to keep them rich\".\nThirty miles south in Darlington, a constituency with a narrower Labour majority of just over 3,000, people seemed more receptive to the Conservative message.\nThe town has had a Tory MP before - Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in the 1980s - and the party has hopes of retaking the seat on 8 June.\n\"I will vote for Theresa May. Not necessarily because she's a Conservative but I think she's the only person for the job. Given the other options,\" says Alex Blackham, owner of a cafe in the town's indoor market.\n\"If she'd been Labour or an independent then I would have been voting for her as a person. I think that's what politics comes down to sometimes.\"\nClive Hinson, a 59-year-old assembly line worker who was about to tuck into one of Mr Blackham's full English breakfasts, blames Thatcher for the closure of the dump truck factory he worked at in the 1980s.\nBut he adds: \"Funnily enough, I'll be voting Conservative. Because I think Corbyn is a waste of time.\n\"He can't give a definitive answer on defence. He's got all these plans for spending loads of money but the figures just don't add up....so much though I don't want to vote Conservative that's the way I'm voting.\"\nHe says the North East has \"forgiven but not forgotten\" Thatcher, comparing the reconciliation process to what happened in Northern Ireland or South Africa. Like Mr Blackham he voted for Brexit in last year's EU referendum.\nMost of the older working class people I spoke to - the traditional bedrock of Labour support in the area - needed no prompting to criticise what they saw as Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership ability and charisma.\nHe seemed to go over much better with younger, more cosmopolitan voters.\n\"I would vote Corbyn all day every day,\" said Stephen Lock, who runs a comic book stall in the covered market with wife June.\n\"He's such a man of the people by the looks of it. He's looking after the general working people. He seems to have great ideas. They may be a little outdated in the modern day, but he's not the person they're painting him out to be. They are trying to make him out to be weak and I don't think he is.\"\nThe couple returned from 13 years in France, where they had a gardening business, after the Brexit vote. \"We thought we had better come back and do something else here. It's affected us quite heavily,\" said Stephen.\nThey are torn between voting Labour and Liberal Democrats - and are not impressed by what they see as the disloyalty of Labour MPs who openly criticise their leader.\n\"The Labour Party is shooting itself in the foot by not acting and standing as one,\" said June.\n\"You have got career politicians that are more concerned about their own personal interests than their constituents.\"\nThere also appeared to real enthusiasm for Corbyn among Darlington's student population, who blame the media for portraying him in a negative light.\n\"You don't see a lot of coverage of, like, nice things about him,\" said 18-year-old Emily Frewin. \"But when you actually read into it he is a nice person.\"\nTheresa May avoids talking to the voters, she adds, but \"he seems like he wants to talk to everybody, not just the rich people\".\n\"He does seem to be getting slandered quite a lot,\" agrees 20-year-old software development student Josh Walker, \"when he's trying to fight for us.\"\nIf the Thatcher factor was ever a major impediment to a Tory revival in the North East, it has undoubtedly faded with time.\nThe party's tactic of detaching Theresa May's name - it was emblazoned across the battle bus she toured the North-East in - from the Conservative brand appears to be working with some voters, who might feel a little queasy at the prospect of putting their cross next to a Tory candidate.\nSome told me they had flirted with a Conservative vote, only to think better of it - Mrs May's support for a free vote on fox hunting, not an issue that has exactly dominated the airwaves, was mentioned by several people as a reason for not switching to the Tories.\nAnd there will always be some who will never forget, or forgive. Like the Darlington woman who greeted Theresa May's name with a horrified cry of \"she's another Maggie Thatcher!\".\nBut on the basis of this highly unscientific sample, Thatcher is no longer the bogey figure she was and Labour can no longer rely on the loyalty of its traditional support base.", "summary": "The Conservatives are hoping to win back seats in the North-East of England on 8 June - has the party finally escaped the shadow of Margaret Thatcher which helped make much of the region a no-go area for them?", "id": "39949130"}

{"document": "It's perceived as the least corrupt country, with the longest surviving multiparty democracy on the continent, and boasts one of the world's fastest-growing economies.\nBut, following the global economic downturn in 2008, and increasingly volatile commodity prices, the country's reliance on diamonds has come into question.\nFor the first time Botswana finds itself cash strapped, in negative growth, and having to go to international donors.\nThe country is looking to diversify its economy by strengthening existing sectors like tourism and cattle farming, and investing in burgeoning industries spawning from technology and entrepreneurship.\nYet diamonds by far outshine any other industry in Botswana, accounting for one-third of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues.\nHowever, production has peaked, and experts believe reserves of the precious stone may run out by 2030.\nUnemployment is also on the rise, with official jobless rates nearing 20%, and an estimated 45% of Botswana's population living below the poverty line.\nEconomic growth was also negative in 2009, and the industrial sector shrank by 30%.\nSigns of labour unrest have also began showing following public sector strikes in recent years.\nAs Linah Mohohlo, who has been governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, put it in a recent interview with BBC Africa Business Report: \"It is a serious concern to government, for many years now strategies have been put in place to diversify the economy away from mining.\"\nIn many ways Botswana is seen as becoming a victim of its own making.\nPolicies have favoured and protected the diamond industry, and strategies and institutions that assisted and protected its growth for decades have made implementation and expansion of newer, alternative industries difficult.\nThe strong role of the state in the economy, plus bloated bureaucracy, often also makes it difficult for investors to enter the market.\nMost contracts are also government sponsored, making it hard for entrepreneurs to set up shop and compete.\nDespite being in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa, and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe makes it a bit of a rough neighbourhood.\nIn response Ms Mohohlo says she's more worried about competition from the country's neighbours, especially for foreign direct investment, and says Botswana needs to \"sharpen its pencils\".\nThe manufacturing industry, for example, has \"not done what we expected it to do\", she says. The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining.\nIn addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge.\nBotswana needs to come up with unique enterprises to compete effectively with South Africa, says Dr Tebogo Seleka, executive director of the Botswana Institute for Development Policy Analysis (Bidpa).\n\"We are both in SACU (Southern African Customs Union), that means goods can enter freely, so if we chose those enterprises that South Africa is more competitive at, that puts us at a disadvantage,\" he says.\nThe key to Botswana's future diversity, many believe, lies in private sector development, and attracting foreign direct investment.\nDr Seleka also believes that due to the country's proximity, combined with its diminutive population, investors tend to set up shop next door.\n\"If a firm from overseas wants to locate in southern Africa, because of Botswana's market size we are at a disadvantage,\" Dr Seleka says.\n\"We also need to look at technology readiness, if you look at the types of technologies firms use, and the rate of adoption of new technologies in Botswana it is still not up to scratch.\"\nOne of the solutions to beefing up diversity in the country's economy may lie with its most abundant animal population.\nCattle outnumber the human population by over a million, and beef is the country's third-largest earner.\nBut despite this, agriculture, in its entirety, only makes up 3% of Botswana's economy.\nBakang Tsheboagae, a cattle farmer from Dutlwe, a village in the Kweneng District of Botswana, says the techniques his family have used for generations to manage their cattle herds have hindered his growth.\nHistorically our way of tracking cattle are earmarks, which are identical, and you can only brand them once they reach a certain age,\" he says.\n\"Livestock multiply, and as you multiply it becomes so difficult to count them, or to know which one is where.\"\nBotswana's cattle and beef industry is driven by exports to Europe, and in order export their beef, farmers must produce traceability records.\n\"I would say whoever has livestock; small, medium or large scale, ultimately you need a tool that will help you account for whatever you are doing,\" says Mr Tsheboagae.\nEnter a new breed of entrepreneur, using technology to modernise the sector.\nThuto Gaotingwe, 26, has developed cattle tracking software Modisar - named after the Tswana word for a herd boy.\nMr Gaotingwe has managed to realise his vision through the help of a one of the government's new entrepreneurial incubators, the Botswana Innovation Hub.\nKnown as a \"quasi government institution\", the innovation hub is described on its website as part of the state's \"national strategic goal for the diversification of the country's economy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 set up to support new ventures and existing companies.\"\nModisar is a productivity software application that can be installed on a farmer's computer or laptop, and allows the farmer to capture information about his or her farm faster.\nMr Gaotingwe explains: \"We are trying to say, 'look you can make money off livestock farming, only if you do it the right way'.\n\"So we have built Modisar, and it allows farmers to keep records of his farm assets. Then it allows farmers to know more about livestock diseases.\"\nAlthough criticised for being reactive as opposed to proactive, the government has implemented a number of policies, strategies and incentive schemes to encourage diversification.\nAn Economic Diversifiation Drive (EDD), for example, has been implemented to strengthen the private sector.\nThe EDD plans to leverage the government's purchasing power, estimated at $2.1bn (\u00c2\u00a31.3bn) per annum, to stimulate local production and consumption by buying from locally based manufacturers and service providers.\nLinah Mohohlo also explains that government has also begun exploring diversification options with in mining sector.\n\"You are now seeing other minerals, such as coal, uranium, copper, nickel coming on-stream,\" says Ms Mohohlo.\nDespite facing obstacles, with the right long-term developmental strategies, Botswana has huge potential to diversify.", "summary": "In Africa, Botswana is often seen as a diamond in the rough.", "id": "30546498"}
{"document": "It's a vivid metaphor from Dr Udai Banerji, of the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden, for the challenge facing patients, scientists and clinicians.\nOver the past 18 months, I've been part of a Panorama team that has followed a group of remarkable cancer patients who are on clinical trials run jointly by the two organisations.\nI met patients like Sophie Armitage, who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called IMFT when she was just nine; and Tami Morris, who has had ovarian cancer for more than a decade.\nTami, like many of those in the trials, has advanced cancer, which has spread from its original site to other parts of the body.\nWith Sophie, the tumour was localised, but growing around her airway and so making it both dangerous and difficult to treat.\nBoth patients are on different forms of targeted drug treatment, part of a new range of weapons against cancer.\nUnlike conventional chemotherapy, which attacks all rapidly dividing cells, targeted drugs focus on the genetic mutations that drive cancer growth.\nThe key to this new generation of cancer drugs is our greater understanding of human genetics.\nA revolution in DNA sequencing means the disease can be mapped faster, cheaper and in greater detail than ever.\nFor Tami Morris, it has meant that pills she takes at home have replaced and outperformed chemotherapy.\nShe told me: \"Five years ago, before the Marsden, I thought that was it. But they've given me a good four years so far.\"\nTami has been on a succession of different targeted treatments designed for patients with specific mutations in their cancer.\nAlthough the drugs have often worked well for some time, eventually her cancer has developed resistance to them, meaning her doctors have had to keep switching her medication.\nCancer resistance is probably the biggest problem facing scientists.\nWatch Panorama: 'Can You Cure My Cancer?' on BBC One on 11 February  at 21.00 GMT or later on the BBC iPlayer.\nBBC iPlayer\nResearchers at the ICR labs in London discovered some years ago that cancer survives through Darwinian evolution.\nProf Johann de Bono is in charge of nearly 40 early drug trials: \"Resistance is a major issue because these are cancers that are genetically unstable, they can change and they evolve, we call this clonal evolution.\"\nBut new drugs are coming through all the time, and so far, the doctors at the ICR and Royal Marsden - who divide their time between laboratories and the clinic - have been able to find a new treatment for Tami.\nBy using drugs in combination or even in rotation, scientists are trying to keep pace with cancer resistance.\nIt will be a key strategy in transforming the disease into a manageable long-term condition.\nOf course, the prospects for cancer patients are far brighter now than ever.\nAlthough one in two of us in our lifetime will hear the words, \"You have cancer,\" survival rates have doubled in the past 40 years.\nCurrently, one in two cancer patients will live at least a decade, and that proportion is increasing each year.\nSome, like Sophie Armitage, can hopefully look forward to a future free from the disease.\nHer tumour was due to a faulty ALK gene, which creates a chemical signal that drives the growth of abnormal cells.\nThe experimental drug she is taking, LDK 378, blocks those messages.\nThe treatment is showing promise against some forms of adult lung cancer.\nSophie had been facing surgery to remove one of her lungs.\nBut within weeks of starting on the trial her tumour had shrunk from the size of a plum to that of a hazel-nut.\nIt has continued to shrink to a point where doctors believe it may be completely inactive.\nHer consultant, Dr Louis Chesler, described Sophie's case as life-affirming.\n\"It's the goal of every paediatric oncologist to see that kind of response.\n\"It's truly astonishing and miraculous to see.  I think we told her in the clinic that she's unique, and that really she's a miracle child.\"\nSophie, who's now 11, says being part of a medical trial has spurred her on to think about what she will do in later life.\nShe told me: \"I've always wanted to be a doctor, and now I've gone through all this I want to be a doctor even more.\"\nAs well as extending life with targeted treatments, scientists are also exploring how to harness the body's inbuilt defences by boosting the power of the immune system.\nCancer immunotherapy has had some spectacular success in recent years, notably in the treatment of malignant melanoma - an aggressive form of skin cancer.\nVicky Brown's melanoma was found only after it had spread to her breast and lungs.\nUntil recently the life expectancy for patients with such advanced disease was around six months, but Vicky enrolled on a trial at the Royal Marsden comparing two immunotherapy treatments, ipilimumab and nivolumab.\nThese drugs help the body's killer cells to recognise cancer cells and prevent malignant cells from blocking the natural immune response.\nVicky had to come off the trial early as she developed hepatitis and meningitis - serious but treatable side-effects which were the result of her immune system being supercharged.\nFortunately, by then the immunotherapy had worked and she remains clear of cancer after more than a year.\nVicky said: \"I can really get on with my life and put this in the back of my mind.\"\nHer consultant at the Royal Marsden, Dr James Larkin, is hopeful that immunotherapy may even be able to deal with the problem of resistance.\nHe told me: \"With immunotherapy, you've reprogrammed the system so inside the patient you have an immune system that can recognise tumour cells.\n\"If a bit of the tumour does become resistant, the experience to date certainly seems to be that the immune system can still deal with that.\"\nSeveral immunotherapy drugs are undergoing trials for other cancers, such as lung and kidney, and early results look promising.\nLike all new cancer treatments, they are expensive - just one of the drugs Vicky was given costs \u00c2\u00a375,000 per patient, although the NHS has negotiated a confidential discounted price.\nSo while these new weapons offer the hope of keeping cancer at bay for longer, they present hard choices for health spending.\nPanorama's 'Can You Cure My Cancer?'  is on Wednesday 11 February at 21:00 on BBC One.", "summary": "\"If you had to describe cancer I would say it's an evil genius.\"", "id": "31365272"}
{"document": "Meanwhile, the big four of Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray show no signs yet of retiring, while others such as Wawrinka, Berdych, and Nishikori also provide competition and excitement for fans and backers of the sport.\nSo it may come as something of a surprise to learn that ATP chief executive Chris Kermode, the man behind the continued upwards trajectory, is about to launch a major review looking ahead to what direction men's tennis should take from 2018 onwards.\n\"We will start the process in 2016, taking a hard look at the long term, and what the ATP stands for,\" he tells me.\n\"Can we offer a better service to players and tournaments? Can we do better in our marketing and promotion, and use social media and digital better?\n\"We will look at how we connect with our audiences, at our TV coverage, our structure of tournaments. Also how many should be in the calendar, and where they should be based? It will be a major work.\"\nHe says there are \"five tennis stakeholders\" to consider - players, tournaments, fans, sponsors and the media.\nThe ATP's review comes after another successful sell-out World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena, where close to 263,000 fans watched the top eight players compete.  It brought the overall attendance on the 2015 ATP World Tour season to an all-time record of 4.5 million fans (excluding Grand Slams).\nMr Kermode says some 15% to 20% of the ATP's annual revenue's annual revenues come from the end of year finals, so as an event it is \"financially very important\".\nNow, the finals will stay in London until 2018, beyond the original 2016 deadline.\nAnd Mr Kermode says that while other cities offered more money, they did not provide the profile - or \"statement for tennis\" - he says they currently enjoy at the O2.\nThe 50-year-old also says he has made a conscious effort to present the ATP finals in a different way to other London tournaments, Wimbledon and the Aegon at Queen's (where he used to be tournament director).\n\"We have made it an entertainment event as much as a sports event,\" says Mr Kermode.\nWorld Tour Finals sponsor Barclays will pull out after the end of 2016, as it cuts back its sport sponsorship, but Mr Kermode says the ATP is confident of finding another big backer.\n\"The issue for us at present is whether we go for a two year sponsor deal around London, or a longer deal that is linked to London and another venue somewhere else,\" says the keen Neil Young music fan.\n\"We are talking to five companies as potential sponsors, and want to be quick in securing a deal.\"\nThe ATP has been boosted by the fact that in the past six months it has secured deals worth $160m (\u00c2\u00a3106m) over the next five years.\nThese include a deal with Emirates, reportedly worth $50m, to replace beer brand Corona as an ATP World Tour sponsor.  The airline's logo will replace those of the Mexican beverage on nets at events.\nNew deals have also been signed with Peugeot, Maui Jim Sunglasses, Indian IT services group Infosys, and Chinese online video business Letv.\nInfosys has been given the task of crunching numbers and stats for tennis fans, and sports media, in the same way that IBM does at Wimbledon and SAP does for the WTA women's tour.\n\"In the US sports stats are of huge interest, historically less so in Europe,\" says Mr Kermode. \"But many new-generation fans are interested in player statistics, and it is an area we want to focus on.\n\"The more knowledge we acquire about our sport, the more fans want it.\"\nWith the sponsorship tank nearly full, he says that there is still room to sign other player-focussed deals with firms providing things like medical services and applications, and fitness products.\nMr Kermode, who is approaching the last 12 months of his current three year term, says he is keen to stay on for another period in office, but that the final decision lies with the ATP board, not him.\nOne projected development he still wants to get off the ground is an end-of-year finals event for the top eight under-21 players in the world.  Originally envisaged for the 2016 calendar, he now says that deadline may be looking tight.\n\"A final decision has still to be made,\" he says, but - whenever launched - it is envisaged the event will slot in between the Paris Masters in late October and ATP finals in London in mid-November.\nAs well as giving young players experience of high-level, pressurised, competition in the global spotlight, and thus increasing their ability to compete at the top ends of ATP events and Grand Slams, he also plans to use the event to innovate.\nOne of these proposed changes might be to the player warm-up, he says.\n\"We currently bring the players dramatically on court at the O2, as though they are coming out for a boxing match, which everyone finds very exciting, \" he says.\n\"But then you get the player warm up, and things cool off for about 10 minutes. It does not matter if you are in the stadium, there is still that buzz, but it can be bit of a dampener for TV viewers.\"\nMeanwhile, he remains sanguine about the day when the \"Big Four\" male players start retiring.\n\"Genuinely, I am not worried about it all,\" says Mr Kermode.\n\"It is like when you had the Borg and McEnroe era, then they retired and you had players like Becker, Agassi, and Edberg, coming through.\"\nHe points to players such as Nishikori (\"huge in Asia\") , Roanic (\"that North American presence\"),  and Dimitrov (\"still to fulfil his potential\"),  as well as youngsters such as Kyrgios and Coric.\n\"There is a great contrast in styles, and good geographical spread,\" he says.  \"Sport is a very simple business model, basically it is about caring about someone winning against someone else, and that will continue.\"", "summary": "Men's professional tennis has enjoyed another high-powered year, with record attendances at the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) World Finals in London last month, as well as a number of major new sponsor deals signed.", "id": "34972475"}
{"document": "Mr Besigye is running against Mr Museveni in the presidential elections for the fourth time, after losing his previous three attempts.\nHe promised in an interview with Uganda's Daily Monitor paper in 2013 that he would not run again but would use other means \"to dismantle the dictatorship\".\nA year later he was still insistent that he would not run, telling Uganda's Observer newspaper that it is impossible to win an election that is being controlled by Mr Museveni.\nBut in 2015, he changed his mind.\nHis campaign rallies for the 2016 election have been characterised by supporters handing over donations, including bunches of bananas and live goats - a stark contrast to most campaign rallies on the continent, which see the candidates distributing gifts hoping to secure the votes of the beneficiaries.\nMr Besigye says previous elections have been rigged and that he has been the victim of a campaign of intimidation by the security forces.\nSome seven months before the 2016 election, Mr Besigye was arrested ahead of a campaign rally, accused of violating public order laws by attempting to hold public meetings without the government's permission.\nOn his way to another rally three days before the election, he was briefly held by police who accused him of disrupting the traffic.\nMr Besigye has been arrested on numerous occasions.\nOn one occasion he was shot in the hand, on another he suffered eye injuries after being doused in pepper spray.\nThe authorities have said Mr Besigye is provoking them, and he has been charged with inciting violence.\nThe charismatic Mr Besigye, 59, is married to Winnie Byanyima, a former MP who is seen as intelligent and ambitious and who was once a close personal friend of Mr Museveni. Mr Besigye and his wife have one son.\nHe was born in the western Rukungiri District, the second child in a family of six and the son of a policeman.\nBesigye's dates with history:\nBoth his parents died while he was at secondary school.\nIn 1975, he headed to Kampala and to medical school at what was then the region's most prestigious university, Makerere.\nIdi Amin was president of Uganda at the time and his army was causing misery in many areas of the country, including on the university campus.\nMr Besigye did not escape that treatment. Aged 18, he was in a Kampala hotel about to have dinner. Walking to the toilets, he stopped to talk to a former classmate.\nA huge man lifted him up by the collar, slapped him hard across the face and sent him sprawling to the floor.\nHe said he never made it to the toilets, and never ate his dinner. He picked himself up and ran for his life.\nFollowing Amin's overthrow, the qualified doctor became a member of the Uganda People's Movement of Yoweri Museveni.\nThe movement had little success in the 1980 election which saw the return of Milton Obote to power, and which is widely considered to have been rigged.\nMr Besigye told the East African newspaper that he did not immediately join Mr Museveni in the bush war.\nBut he was imprisoned for two months in the Nile Hotel in 1981, accused of working with the rebels, and tortured.\nMr Besigye fled to Nairobi and in 1982 joined Mr Museveni in the bush, where he became his personal doctor.\nAlthough rarely at the battle front, Mr Besigye was deployed in divisions which were sent into battle where he treated the casualties.\nKizza Besigye on his 2001-2005 exile:\n\"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened\"\nWhen Mr Museveni came to power, Mr Besigye, aged just 29, was appointed state minister of internal affairs and national political commissar.\nThese appointments shocked some who had been in the bush with Mr Besigye, as he had not been heavily involved in the political side of the bush war.\nSome believe Mr Besigye's rapid rise led to him being viewed as a potential threat to the president, and as a result he was given less demanding work during the 1990s.\nMr Besigye rose to the rank of colonel in the army but did not retire from it until shortly before the 2001 elections - having written a document that accused the ruling National Resistance Movement of being undemocratic, dishonest and corrupt. It almost earned him a court martial.\nA few months before the election, he emerged as a presidential candidate.\nHaving lost to Mr Museveni, he went to court and challenged the result on the grounds that the state had used force, intimidation and violence.\nHe lost the case on a split decision and then fled the country.\nOn his return in 2005 he said: \"I left in order to continue to be politically active rather than being behind bars or six feet under as had been threatened.\"\nMore on Uganda's election:\nAfter he returned to Uganda ahead of the 2006 elections, he was arrested and charged with both treason and rape.\nThe charges were later dismissed, but not until long after the polls and they obviously distracted him from campaigning.\nThe rape prosecution was dismissed as \"crude and amateurish\" but the treason charges hung over his head until 2010.\nHis lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the 2006 results, alleging widespread fraud. Mr Besigye won 37%.\nThe government says Mr Besigye has connections with a rebel group, and this accusation led to charges.\nHe denied any rebel link, although he has said he would not rule out going to the bush to battle the government if the constitution was overthrown and needed to be reinstated.\nAfter he lost the last election in 2011, Mr Besigye said all the votes were flawed.\nBefore the 2011 polls, Mr Besigye had called for popular uprisings in the event of fraud.\nAnd after gaining 26% to the president's 68% in the vote, the leader of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) claimed it was rigged.\nAfter the election he continued to campaign against the result, along with the rising cost of living, by staging \"walk to work\" protests.\nHe was arrested four times, accused of inciting violence and beaten by police during the protests before all charges were dropped.\nHuman rights groups condemned the brutality of the police and military.\nHis critics see him as a power-hungry attention seeker. But others praise him for standing up to authority.\nMr Besigye himself says his mission is \"to work with millions of other Ugandans in bringing about a stable democratic and peaceful Uganda\".", "summary": "Kizza Besigye used to be President Yoweri Museveni's personal doctor but he went on to become an opposition leader and has referred to Uganda's leader as a \"dictator\".", "id": "12431180"}

But the reception given by the away fans to their players at the final whistle suggests they are optimistic a 13-year absence from the Premier League may be coming to an end in the near future.\nLeeds United manager Garry Monk:\n\"I asked them to play in slightly different way to what we have been doing tactically, which we had to do against a very good side\n\"We followed it to a tee. It just lacked us taking one of quite a few opportunities. We had the best chances of the game.\n\"It needed a bit more composure, that's the only negative. Better decision-making in the final third and we would have had a couple of goals. Overall I was gutted for the players.\n\"As a performance for a young, inexperienced team these type of nights set a marker for you. We're growing. We are disappointed but they will look back in time and think we have put on a good performance\n\"I'm not going to criticise my team - they were excellent.\"\nBack to a Premier League title push for Liverpool.

That is to say it is all about balancing risk and benefit - and as evidence is still emerging it is only natural to find a variety of opinion.\nOn their own, there is little to recommend the use of e-cigarettes. They contain some toxins and, therefore, in theory are potentially harmful - both to those using them and, possibly, through passive smoking.\nBut this debate is further complicated by the fact that it is not just the merits of e-cigarettes that are being discussed, but their impact on smoking tobacco products. Some, for example, have argued they act as a gateway to real smoking.\nBut, of course, e-cigarettes cannot be seen in isolation. Smoking them - and this is about the only thing that is not disputed - is less harmful than tobacco products. That, in a nutshell, is why some claim they should be treated sympathetically.\nOfficials acknowledge there is divided opinion but believe the evidence is now growing to support a ban. Although the numbers of children using e-cigarettes are low, ministers do not want to take the risk of children seeing smoking \"normalised\" again after the success in banning smoking.\nThere are similar e-cigarette restrictions in countries like Belgium, Spain and Malta, with proposals in France and Ireland. But this would be a first for the UK.\nThe BMA says it is \"vital\" that e-cigarettes do not undermine tobacco control and they are particularly worried that the way they are marketed is making them attractive to children.\nIt also says more research is needed to find out whether e-cigarettes actually help smokers to quit.\nTATTOOS AND PIERCINGS\nA licensing system is also being drawn up with the tattoo and piercing industry - to produce enforceable professional hygiene and health standards  by 2017.\nThere are already around 350 tattoo premises with licences in Wales but  there are many others, including self-taught tattooists called \"scratchers\".\nIt is a recognition that times have changed dramatically since the last legislation in the early 1980s, with tattoos and piercings more popular.\nThere will also be a ban on intimate piercings for the under-16s.\nMinisters say the industry welcomes the new system - backed up by the threat of prosecution and fines - which will see tattooists having to show they are competent.\nBETTER ACCESS TO TOILETS\nCouncils will also be expected to produce a local toilets' strategy and to involve shops and other businesses in providing \"creative solutions\" to meet local needs.\nIt recognises the budget constraints to councils and that it has become an issue of access to \"toilets in public\" rather than public toilets - those owned and run by local authorities.\nHealth Minister Mark Drakeford said they wanted to get the balance right between all the things that would make a big difference to people's health  in the future \"while not wanting to intrude on the legitimate rights people have to run their own lives.\"\nHe added: \"The Welsh government has a responsibility to create the conditions which enable people to live healthy lives and avoid preventable harm to their health.\"\nAttempts to bring in a minimum price for alcohol are still being worked on but will not be included in the bill until the outcome of a European Court of Justice hearing on similar legislation in Scotland.\nREACTION\nShadow Conservative health minister Darren Millar AM said he feared some aspects of the bill interfered in individual rights.\n\"E-cigarettes are a staging post for many smokers on the road to quitting and moves to restrict them will make it more difficult for smokers to kick the habit,\" he said.\nPlaid Cymru health spokeswoman Elin Jones said the assembly now needed to \"consider all of the evidence that relates to the effect of e-cigarettes on public health, most of which is newly-emerging\".\n\"E-cigarettes are used widely by people who are trying to give up smoking, so we should be very careful not to halt that trend,\" she said.\nWelsh Lib Dems leader Kirsty Williams AM said the e-cigarette ban was completely unjustifiable.\n\"The evidence for this decision is wafer thin,\" she said.  \"Banning things just for the sake of it isn't a position any government should take.\"\nThe Royal College of Physicians was disappointed there was no firm action on tackling obesity and physical inactivity \"which has a huge impact on health and chronic illness\".", "summary": "People will be banned from using e-cigarettes in enclosed places such as restaurants, pubs and at work in Wales, under a new public health law.", "id": "33025872"}

Instead, it was his United team who provided the generosity.\nAnd the home fans could not resist a cheeky dig at their former boss - chanting \"you're not special anymore\" to the self-proclaimed Special One.\nMourinho said before the game he would not \"celebrate like a crazy kid\" if his new team scored at Stamford Bridge.\nUnfortunately for him, there was little sign of that resolve being put to the test as Chelsea capitalised on his side's defensive deficiencies.\nUnited were ragged at the back, ripped open by Pedro's opener without even having a touch and left flapping from then on.\nAnd the severity of the scoreline was emphasised by some startling statistics:\nThe tone was set when Chris Smalling hesitated in dealing with a long ball, allowing Pedro to nip in and round David de Gea - and United never recovered.\nThe basic ability to defend a set-piece eluded them for Chelsea's second, two deflected touches helping the ball on to the unmarked Cahill, who lashed in.\nUnited, without the injured Wayne Rooney, looked unrecognisable from the side that dug in to keep a clean sheet at Anfield on Monday. They looked unrecognisable from any Mourinho side, always expected to be well organised and difficult to break down.\nA stony-faced Mourinho watched his static defenders allow Hazard and then Kante to skip into space and score after the break, leaving new Chelsea manager Antonio Conte lapping up the acclaim of a home crowd revelling in their former boss's misfortune.\n\"We made incredible defensive mistakes,\" said Mourinho. \"And then you pay for that.\"\nFormer Italy manager Antonio Conte was tasked with restoring Chelsea's fortunes after a chastening season, which started under Mourinho's leadership and ended in the defending champions finishing 10th.\nConte's start has not been smooth, however.\nBack-to-back league defeats against Liverpool and Arsenal last month led to some criticism, forcing him to laugh off rumours of his imminent sacking.\nBut, after making a tactical switch to a 3-5-2 formation following those defeats, Conte has seen his team flourish.\nThree successive victories have pushed the Blues back among the frontrunners, with the Stamford Bridge crowd showing their appreciation for the new manager as he urged them to make more noise during the second half.\n\"It is important for the manager to find the right solution for your team,\" said Conte on his team's recent revival.\n\"It was not a good situation when Chelsea conceded in every game - we change and now we are playing good football.\"\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte:\n\"We made a fantastic start. We scored the early goal but we continued to play good football, intensity and possession, create many chances. Today we didn't concede, which was important.

{"document": "Tuition fees for 2017 are listed on Durham, Kent and Royal Holloway websites as \u00a39,250.\nMPs will vote in the autumn on whether to allow an increase in tuition fees.\nThe government will support an increase if universities can show they have high quality teaching.\nAnnouncing a higher level of fees of \u00a39,250 was attacked as \"disgraceful arrogance from some universities\" by the Liberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh.\nThe proposal to raise fees is \"not a done deal\", says Mr Pugh.\nSally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: 'Those universities foolish enough to advertise higher fees will be doing nothing to quell concerns from students and parents that they are simply after as much cash as they can get.\"\nThe higher level fees now being advertised are for undergraduate courses starting in autumn 2017.\nStudents will start applying for these courses after the summer holidays.\nThere are references on university websites to fees being \"subject to government confirmation\" and \"inflationary changes\", but this comes before MPs have voted on legislation which will link fee increases to standards of teaching.\nThere will also be a separate vote by MPs in the autumn on whether to permit an increase in tuition fees above \u00a39,000.\nUnder the government's proposals, if universities meet a threshold of good-quality teaching, they will be able to increase fees with inflation, which for 2017 is calculated as allowing an extra \u00a3250.\nAt this rate, tuition fees could be over \u00a310,000 within the next four years.\nThe plans in the Higher Education and Research Bill are before Parliament and in a debate on Tuesday, Labour's Gordon Marsden warned this inflation link meant there was no guarantee on how high fees could rise.\nThe process that will be created to measure teaching quality in universities is called the \"teaching excellence framework\".\nThis framework does not yet exist, but for its first year the government has said that almost all universities will be assessed as having reached a quality threshold, allowing them to push their fees above the \u00a39,000 upper limit.\nIt means that almost all universities will be able to charge \u00a39,250 for their autumn 2017 intake, making it in effect the new upper limit.\nLabour's shadow education minister Gordon Marsden said it was a \"back-door attempt to raise fees, without a proper and open debate in Parliament, by linking it to a teaching excellence framework which hasn't yet been defined\".\nBut the Liberal Democrats' Mr Pugh said \"The real question is whether government is giving these institutions the green light to advertise higher fees.\n\"They've not even shown their plans for linking fee rises to Parliament. So why are they giving universities the impression that they will pass their teaching quality assessment?\"\nThe University of Kent said the fee increase represented inflation of 2.8%, which could be applied \"where higher education providers achieve a rating of 'meets expectations' under the teaching excellence framework\".\nA statement said it had published the higher fee \"to ensure that both potential students and existing students are provided with as much notice as possible\" and to comply with consumer protection guidelines.\nDurham University issued a statement saying it was setting fees in line with what the government was going to allow and said \"we are required to provide comprehensive and transparent information to applicants\".\nResponding to MPs' concerns about tuition fee increases, Education Secretary Justine Greening told the House of Commons on Tuesday: \"This will rightly continue to require the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as before and the Bill will allow the maximum fee cap to keep pace with inflation.\"\nThe government argues that without an inflationary increase, the value of tuition fees, providing \u00a311.6bn to universities, will be eroded.\nOther universities are still advertising fees at \u00a39,000, but with a warning about a possible increase.\nManchester Metropolitan University advertises fees of \u00a39,000 for 2017, but with a note that says \"these fees are regulated by the UK government, and so may increase each year in line with government policy\".\nThe University of Newcastle quotes a \u00a39,000 fee but says it might increase with inflation for those entering in 2017.\nOther universities, such as University College London, have so far not published fees for 2017 on their websites.\nThe increase in fees in England to \u00a39,000 per year was introduced in 2012 by the coalition government and prompted angry protests from students.\nIn Scottish universities, students from Scotland do not have to pay tuition fees. Northern Irish students at Northern Irish universities have fees of up to \u00a33,925 and Welsh students have fees of \u00a33,810.\nSorana Vieru, vice president of the National Union of Students, warned of higher levels of debt for students.\n\"A further fee rise will have a damaging impact on students and it is frustrating to learn universities were lobbying the minister for the fee rise before the reforms were published.\"\nA government spokeswoman said: \"The teaching excellence framework will allow universities to maintain fees in line with inflation only if they meet a quality bar, as set out in the recent higher education White Paper.\"", "summary": "Universities in England are already announcing a tuition fee increase above the \u00a39,000 limit before Parliament has even finished debating plans which would pave the way to raise fees.", "id": "36845106"}
{"document": "The Rolling Stones apparently charge $8m (\u00a35m) to do a one-off performance, while Sir Elton John is said to require $4m.\nKylie Minogue - who once sang at the wedding of the daughter of Indian steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal - is reported to be a more affordable $2m.\nSo for those of us without superwealth, arranging such a gig seems impossible.\nHowever, help may now be at hand thanks to three music fans and their London-based company Songkick.\nA concert notification website and app for your mobile phone and tablet, Songkick this year launched a new service called Detour.\nEssentially a form of crowdfunding, fans who wish to bring a certain band to their hometown or city can start a petition or \"pledge\" via Songkick.\nYou enter your credit card details on Songkick's website or app, and how much you would be prepared to pay.\nIf a sufficiently large number of people also pledge, then Songkick informs the band in question and its promoters.\n\"We have launched the service in London, targeting smaller bands and venues,\" says Songkick's co-founder and chief executive Ian Hogarth.\n\"But we plan to extend it across the UK and globally, and ultimately to the largest venues and artists.\n\"Obviously there is no guarantee that the band or singer in question will ultimately agree to play in a certain town, but so far more than 90% have indeed done so to - performing live is after all how bands make the majority of their money these days.\"\nBut if you and your friends are indeed successful in bringing to Rolling Stones to your town, how much do you pay via Songkick?\nIan says: \"You ultimately pay the ticket price as set by the band.  So if you have pledged more, you don't pay the difference. And if you have pledged less than the ticket price, we contact you to say you'll need to pay more.\n\"And of course you can pull out of paying if ultimately you don't want to, or can't make the concert for some reason.\"\nSo if that is how Songkick's Detour service helps music fans, how does it benefit the bands or solo artists?\nPut simply, Songkick passes on vital information to bands about how many people would like to see them play live in a certain place - and the prices they are prepared to pay for tickets.\nFrom this data bands can work out which towns and cities to go to, the correct size for a venue, the optimum number of concerts to play and how much to charge. And Songkick gets a cut of the ticket price.\nWith an average of 50% of all concert tickets currently going unsold in countries such as the UK and US, Songkick claims the information it provides is the holy grail for the live music industry.\nIan says: \"It is about bringing 21st Century technology to the live music industry.\"\nBased in the Hoxton area of east London, the other, and currently larger, part of Songkick's business is a notification system that means music fans can avoid missing out on seeing their favourite band or singer perform live.\nFree to use for the consumer, it sends you an alert when a band or singer you like is about to release tickets for a tour due to visit a city or town near you.\nYou can then buy the tickets via Songkick, which takes a commission of up to 10% from the promoter.\nSongkick's technology means that the user doesn't have to enter a list of bands and singers that he or she likes, as instead it automatically checks your digital music collection, and what you listen to on streaming services such as Spotify.\nIan and his two co-founders started the company when he was just 25. Now six years later, it is a global operation used by eight million people per month.\nFor Ian, a Londoner who studied engineering and software at Cambridge University, it was working in California's Silicon Valley that made him realise you are never too young to launch a new technology company.\n\"Living in the Valley for a year was a really influential experience,\" he says. \"The head of data at Facebook at the time was my age. It helped me realise that you could just go for it and start a business if you were interested in solving a particular problem.\n\"The actual idea came from my co-founder Michelle You, we are both really big gig-goers, and she said, 'Is there a way to use technology to make it easier to know when a band you like is going on tour?'\n\"I had the tech background to say 'yes it can be done', and Songkick came from there.\"\nIan says he \"always wanted to build something\".\n\"It didn't have to be a company, an invention would have done. I'm always most excited when making something.\"\nBut after graduating, Ian's love of music and China initially saw him spend a year in Beijing, learning Mandarin and earning money as a DJ playing hip-hop.\nIt was also in Beijing that he first met Californian Michelle You, who was a fellow pupil at the same language class.\nThey both kept in touch when they left China, with Ian working in Silicon Valley for management consultants Bain & Company, and Michelle in New York.\nAfter Michelle questioned how technology could be used to better used to find out about forthcoming concerts, the idea for Songkick was born.\nQuitting their day jobs together with third co-founder Pete Smith, a friend of Ian's since Cambridge, they set up the company, initially using their own money.\nIan says that while he and his colleagues could have based Songkick in California, they chose London because: \"It is the gig capital of the world. London has more concerts than anywhere else.\"\nHe says the company is proud to be doing its bit to help the wider music industry.\n\"The music industry has been through a huge amount of change in recent years. Not helped by illegal downloads, sales have fallen sharply.\n\"So now bands make 70% of their income from touring. But at the same time, on average, half of all concert tickets go unsold. Songkick is helping sell those spare tickets.\"\nNow backed by venture capital funding, including $10m (\u00a36.4m) last year from Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley firm that has previously funded the likes of Google, Apple and PayPal, Songkick still has just 30 members of staff.\n\"We are a small team, but the important thing is the talent density - our staff are extremely talented,\" says Ian.\nAnd while he says he finds it difficult not to spend all his time thinking about the company, he is happy to delegate.\n\"I see my job as attracting exceptional people to solve problems, and then getting out of the way to let them do it.\"\nIan now intends to grow Songkick's business tenfold over the next five years, and is relaxed about the possibility of the established ticket agencies doing something similar to both its core business and new Detour operation.\nHe says: \"Our biggest competitors are the ones you don't know about - the three people in a bedroom coming at it from a completely different angle.\"", "summary": "Ever fancied organising a concert by your favourite band or singer?", "id": "22765879"}

{"document": "Eoin Morgan of England, Steve Smith of Australia and Kane Williamson of New Zealand are three great cricketers and captains who will be watching the final from the sidelines, perhaps pondering the often tiny margins between victory and defeat in these tournaments.\nAs South Africa captain, I know how they feel.\nYet while the disappointed captains of eliminated teams must accept the reality of recriminations and a social media backlash, Virat has managed to guide his team through to the final and now, once again, stands centre stage for the showpiece occasion.\nAt 28, he is at the peak of his powers, surely the outstanding cricketer in the world today.\nI have been privileged to play alongside him in the last six Indian Premier League tournaments and, as his team-mate at Royal Challengers Bangalore, have seen at first hand not only his extraordinary skill as a batsman but also the energy and intensity that he brings to the game.\nHe is a consummate surgeon at the crease, intensely focussed, working hard, playing the ball into gaps in the field and staying calm under pressure. He is always judging the right time to consolidate and the right time to seize a game by the scruff of the neck.\nThe sheer volume of his runs leaves no room for debate: Virat has scored 8,008 runs in 183 one-day internationals, at an average of 54.47, and this week moved to the top of the ICC rankings of ODI batsmen.\nHe has found his best form in this tournament, scoring an unbeaten 81 in India's opening win over Pakistan, adding an unbeaten 76 in the do-or-die victory over South Africa, and compiling a clinical and commanding 96 not out in the semi-final victory over Bangladesh.\nIndia's batting order is decorated with many brilliant talents, but the Pakistan bowlers will realise the paramount importance of controlling Virat on Sunday.\nHe has been blessed with wonderful natural talent but, as ever among high achievers, his talent is underpinned by a willingness to work hard.\nUnseen, he is determined and relentless in training, remaining in the nets as long as necessary to ensure he feels comfortable with every aspect of his game. I have watched him rehearse his strokes over and over again, until sweat is pouring from his brow, never stopping until he is satisfied.\nBeyond the golden talent and the iron determination, Virat has learned how to cope with the pressures of his exalted position.\nIf you drive into almost any city in India, you will see his face appear on every other billboard. Being the most marketable and possibly the most popular personality in a nation of 1.3bn people brings its own pressures: he simply cannot move without being begged for a 'selfie' and his every move, word and even gesture is relentlessly reported in print, electronic and social media.\nTwitter whirred when he stuck out his tongue to celebrate a wicket against Bangladesh.\nVirat has learned to live with these realities... and also to accept the burden of unrealistic expectation that he should score runs every time he reaches the crease, and that his team should win every time they take the field.\nWhen things don't go well - and, unfortunately, for Virat as for anyone else, things don't always go well - he falls back on his intense commitment and works ever harder until he turns the corner and meets the excessively high expectations.\nThere were occasions earlier in his career when his determination to succeed spilled over into outbursts anger and volatility on the field, but such incidents are rare now. He has evolved into the very model of a calm, clinical and confident professional cricketer, seemingly in control of every situation.\nIntense and serious in matches and at practice, he retains the invaluable ability to switch off from the game, relaxing, laughing and joking at every opportunity.\nHe enjoys calling people by playful nicknames and he can find humour in almost every situation, even when we are spending hour after hour at another photo shoot, waiting for the photographer to be ready, then being told how and where to pose, then waiting some more, then being told we have to start the process all over again.\nWhile some of his team-mates are getting frustrated and struggling to be patient and composed, Virat will find something funny and deftly defuse the situation.\nSo he continues to thrive, and so his Indian team continue to enjoy remarkably consistent success at ICC tournaments.\nNot long ago, on the morning after an away match in the Indian Premier League, I arrived at breakfast in the hotel to find Virat sitting on his own.\nWe started chatting about the game of cricket, a little about the pressures and the expectations... but mostly we spoke about the fantastic privilege to play for and to captain your country, and we agreed that we should savour every moment of what, to be honest, remains a special and wonderful way to make a living.\nVirat is five years younger than me, so I asked him: \"How long do you think you will keep playing the game?\"\nHe responded instantly, eyes alight.\n\"I'm going to play forever,\" he said, his face breaking into a broad smile.\nAnd so 'forever' continues on Sunday at The Oval.", "summary": "There are a few people who would love to be standing in Virat Kohli's shoes this weekend, leading their national team into the final of Champions Trophy, and there is no doubt the captain of India will be relishing the prospect of Sunday's final against Pakistan at The Oval.", "id": "40306937"}

The pupils involved showed reticence so they had a chat with the civics teachers.\nThe school was at the heart of the events, close to the Charlie Hebdo offices. One of my students heard the shots being fired by the Kouachi brothers. Many of our pupils skateboard in Place de la Republique. It all meant a lot to them. They needed to make sense what had happened.\nWe discussed the issues: it was the first act of war in Paris for a long time. We talked about caricatures, blasphemy, freedom of speech. A few loudmouths said: \"They [Charlie Hebdo] were asking for it.\" We discussed this in class and some of them ultimately revised their opinion. So what we had was mostly blustering.\nIt was very spontaneous. On the Thursday morning I saw some of my final-year students as I came in. They asked me for adhesive tape because they wanted to make banners. They took the initiative very quickly. They went to see the head teacher to get authorisation for their plan. They made a speech to younger students after the minute of silence on Friday, then demonstrated across the city, and of course took part in the main [unity] rally on Sunday.\nThe initial reaction was one of unanimous revulsion among pupils. On the Thursday everyone agreed that you don't kill people because you are offended by drawings, regardless of your beliefs.\nOn the Friday, frictions started to creep in. Then there was the mass \"Je suis Charlie\" demonstration at the weekend. When the pupils returned to school on the Monday, the disruption began. Two pupils found conspiracy theories on the internet: The Kouachi brothers were innocent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Wasn't it strange that police had found the ID card left in the car? It was obviously a plot by intelligence services\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nI asked what purpose there could be in killing people of various ethnicities and religions.  They came back with the answer: \"To sully Islam.\" I was surprised because those two boys of North African origin had never said that sort of thing. But they were defiant. I represented the official version, and they had access to a hidden truth.\nProblems in the school system run deep. Courses on the Enlightenment, for instance, can be a problem. In a class last week I was analysing an article by Voltaire on religious fanaticism, which is on the national curriculum. As I was talking, the pupils were listening so intently that there was silence. Suddenly two of them made increasingly loud snoring noises that ended up covering my voice.\nSecularism is not the only sensitive issue. It is also difficult to teach colonial wars. You will be challenged, some will whistle or hum to stop you talking. You will be accused of dishing out propaganda. I noticed an abrupt change in 2001, when I was teaching in an immigrant suburb. My students refused to observe a minute's silence for the victims of 9/11. The most radical among them started singing Hamas songs. I was a young teacher and did not know what to do.\nDiscipline is a big problem. When people talk in class and the teacher tells them to be quiet, a common retort is: \"I'm not talking to you\" - meaning you're interrupting my conversation. What plays against me is that I am a woman - some pupils will not respect me.\nIf I have two or three troublemakers per class here, I can only imagine what it must be like for my colleagues who have remained in deprived suburbs. Boosting civics courses and encouraging pupils to sing the Marseillaise (as the education minister suggested following 200 reported incidents during the minute's silence) does not go nearly far enough to tackle the underlying problems.\nWhen I heard pupils recycling conspiracy theories after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, it reminded me of 9/11. The very next day, on 12 September, a boy said in class that Jews were behind the attack. He knew this because there were no Jews in the twin towers at the time. I said: \"You must be really smart! We still don't know the number of victims, but you already have the list, with their religion.\" Everybody laughed. The kid felt a bit silly and I defused the situation that way.\nWhen I am confronted with that sort of thing I now use texts by Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden and other classics of the conspiracy genre to show the similarities between their visions of the world: a hidden elite is pulling the strings - often the same people incidentally. And I show that such ideas have serious consequences: tens of millions of people killed in the case of Nazism and Stalinism.\nIt can be tricky teaching some subjects - such as the Holocaust, colonial wars, or the Middle East - but this is mostly a problem of teacher training. When a kid tells you a genocide has been committed by the French in Algeria or by the Israelis in Gaza, you have to refer to the official definition of a genocide and see whether its applies. You are going to be challenged: background knowledge and a good relationship with pupils are vital to meet that challenge.\nToday teachers are competing with other sources of information - notably social networks and the internet. Teachers are no longer the ultimate source of knowledge.  So you have to be extremely strong on learning in order to have authority. And if there is an emotional bond with the pupils, you can deliver any message.\nOn the Thursday (a day after the Charlie Hebdo attack) I was shaken by what I had seen on TV.  I spoke to the head teacher, who gave me permission to post a \"Je suis Charlie\" banner in my classroom. But he also said something that surprised me: he would not force teachers to enforce the minute's silence (declared by the education minister) on the Friday. He had anticipated problems - but I had not. I could not imagine that pupils would not observe a minute's silence.\nThen I faced my class of 14 to 15-year-olds, with whom I have a wonderful relationship. I asked how they felt about the events of the previous day, without giving my own reaction. Their response hit me in the guts: \"Miss, the journalists got what was coming to them\"; \"You should not mock the Prophet.\"  Only the Muslim pupils spoke - about a third of the class. The others did not say a word. When they saw the tear on my face, they held back: they did not want to upset me.\nIn my younger class, they were even more virulent. \"When you receive death threats you have to stop what you are doing,\" they said. On the Friday they all observed the minute's silence, but I did not feel it was out of respect for the victims - but out of respect for me. Some of my colleagues who do not have that sort of relationship with their pupils had problems; others did not observe it at all.\nMore recently, a boy mimicked the killings in a corridor, firing an imaginary Kalashnikov and shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is great, in Arabic).\nI thought the battle of secularism had been won, and that after several years in school they had absorbed all this. But I now realise that this is not the case. But I will not give up. I will continue to fight for my convictions. I am a daughter and granddaughter of teachers: secularism and the values of the Republic are in my genes. If there were more teachers like me - more teachers who believe in what they do and stop looking the other way, things would be better.", "summary": "Here teachers in France tell the BBC about their struggles to assert the country's traditional values of free expression and secularism in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks.", "id": "31037598"}
{"document": "Probably not - for two sets of reasons.\nFirst, the basic facts have not changed - there is no doubt that the situation inside the Labour Party remains dangerously unstable, with probably a majority of Labour MPs deeply uncomfortable with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.\nBut his is a leadership his party members want, overwhelmingly so. And were a coup to be staged the membership would either re-elect him, or elect someone similar.\nWe're in Bertolt Brecht territory here: the easiest solution for Corbyn-sceptic MPs would be to dissolve the party membership and elect another, as the poet ironically suggested for the Communist regime in 1953.\nBut, failing that, they have to wait for the membership to change its mind.\nThe tactics of any coup attempt revolve around the different views of what might have to occur to trigger such a change.\nSome think serious electoral reverses in next May's round of elections (the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, the London mayor etc) might do the trick.\nLondon could be particularly significant, both as the place where Labour did best at the election in May and as the heartland of the Corbynistas.\nThe argument is that the election of a Tory mayor and a rough ride on the doorstep might re-educate enough of the new wave of Labour members to allow a different leader to be elected.\nOthers argue that it might take two such rounds of May defeats to change enough minds. This, of course, relies on those defeats actually occurring, not to mention them having the effect the anti-Corbyn camp want. We shall see.\nAnd it's also worth underlining that the Syria intervention is an issue where Mr Corbyn is in tune with his membership.\nThen there's the not insignificant question of how a leadership challenge would be triggered.\nI'm told some Labour MPs have been digging into the archives to study how Hilary's dad, Tony Benn, went about challenging Neil Kinnock, in 1988, and that legal opinions on what Labour's murky and overlapping internal rules might actually mean are being studied in various Westminster offices.\nOne of the key questions is whether Mr Corbyn, if challenged, would need to be nominated by 35 MPs in order to defend his position or whether he would be assured of an automatic position on the ballot papers.\nSecond, there's the climate within the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). One of the key problems for the coup plotters is identifying an alternative leader, to play Michael Howard to Mr Corbyn's Iain Duncan Smith, and at least keep the Labour show on the road in the 2020 election.\nMr Benn has certainly put his head above the parapet - but he's done so on an issue that is highly divisive within the PLP, rather than one of the several causes which pit most Labour MPs against their leader.\nTake a look at the voting list on Wednesday, where two married couples - Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey and Jenny Chapman and Nick Smith - were split on the issue.\nIn that agonised atmosphere, Mr Benn's moral certainties may not play well in the longer term, whatever their on the day impact.\nHe may have given a masterly Commons performance (a real rarity these days) and made a powerful speech setting out the moral case for military intervention, in terms that had many Tory, as well as Labour, MPs swooning.\n\"He's clearly running for the leadership - but of which party?\" tittered one SNP MP.\nBut most of Mr Benn's Labour colleagues were conflicted about the issue of whether intervention would work\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and I'm not sure the appeal he made to their internationalist roots and to memories of Arthur Greenwood \"speaking for England\" in 1940 will have won over those who doubt both their leader and the case for military action.\nCertainly there were plenty of MPs from what might be called the \"right\" of the PLP who didn't back the government motion.\nSo it may be worth watching other figures who didn't break cover last night - Rachel Reeves, anyone?\nAll the same, Mr Corbyn's position has been weakened. He was forced to concede a free vote, under the threat of losing much of his shadow cabinet.\nHe was comprehensively outperformed by his shadow foreign secretary and some of his internal critics suspect that competence rather than ideology might be the most corrosive issue for his leadership.\nThis week also saw brutal meetings of the shadow cabinet and the PLP, and, ultimately, a significant chunk of the front bench voting with the government (Hilary Benn, Michael Dugher, Maria Eagle, Angela Eagle, Vernon Coaker, Tom Watson, Lucy Powell, Heidi Alexander, Chris Bryant, Gloria De Piero and Luciana Berger, for the record).\nAnd that list included one of his personal left-field picks for high office, the shadow health secretary Ms Alexander. She's proved an effective performer, but I suspect her name is mud in the Corbyn inner circle.\nNow there will be recriminations and, possibly, attempts at constituency level to deselect the recusants (there does not have to be a return to the '80s era of mandatory reselection; the coming Commons boundary changes will ensure most sitting MPs will not face a simple rubber-stamping to become their party's candidate again).\nIf they succeed, some MPs may quit immediately, forcing uncomfortable by-elections, or simply go rogue in the Commons and vote as they please.\nWe're still some way from further 80s retro developments like an SDP-style breakaway. And defections to the Liberal Democrats seem improbable, both because of the extent of their implosion last May and because a lot of Labour MPs regard the party's new leader, Tim Farron, as \"Corbyn lite\".\nSo we're left with a destabilised official opposition and no obvious way to resolve its problems that does not involve a major smackdown.\nThings will get worse in the Labour Party before they get better.\nFind out how your MP voted\nFind out which constituency you live in\n*The Commons is made up of 650 MPs but the Speaker and his three deputies cannot vote while Sinn Fein's four MPs do not take their seats and did not take part.\n*There is also currently no MP for Oldham West and Royton, with a by-election taking place on Thursday.", "summary": "Does Hilary Benn's barnstorming performance in the Syria debate mean he's about to displace his leader in some kind of Labour palace coup?", "id": "34994457"}
{"document": "The Dane, Cardiff's top scorer last season, had seen an early effort ruled out for off-side and then found Burton keeper Stephen Bywater in fine form.\nBut with three minutes left Zohore held off two defenders to curl a shot home.\nBurton could have led in the first half when Marvin Sordell's goal-bound shot was blocked, but had to thank Bywater after half-time as Cardiff dominated.\nLuck had not been with Nigel Clough's side this week with Liam Boyce suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury that will keep the striker out for most of the season.\nBut Burton were thankful to survive an early scare when Zohore pulled away at the back post to turn in Joe Bennett's cross, only to be flagged for off-side.\nZohore had an even better chance after being played through by Lee Tomlin, but shot wide across Bywater's goal.\nBurton should have scored as the game sparked to life just before the break, only for Sol Bamba's last-ditch tackle to deny Sordell from Lloyd Dyer's pull-back.\nCardiff started the second half with more urgency and - cheered on by 1,700 travelling fans in a 5,050 crowd at the Pirelli Stadium - soon created a chance for Junior Hoilett, whose shot deflected just wide of the near post.\nFrom the resulting corner Bywater pulled off a fine save to stop Bamba's powerful effort. The defender was proving a real nuisance for Albion and Bamba again got free from a free-kick, but headed straight at Bywater.\nThe Bluebirds turned the screw as Cardiff boss Neil Warnock made attack-minded changes and Hoilett's header was deflected wide, Zohore's shot was tipped over and Mendez-Laing blazed wide when well placed.\nBut just as Albion, again tipped as one of the relegation favourites, looked to have battled to a point, Zohore bullied his way into the area to give Warnock a perfect start to his 50th year in football.\nBurton manager Nigel Clough:\n\"In the second half they put us under a lot of pressure.

{"document": "One year on, the first handball matches since the Olympic Games have taken place inside the venue - reborn as a sports centre for the community - and  on its hallowed London 2012 floor tiles. Handball will be a regular feature here.\nIf you missed it at London 2012, handball is played on an indoor court between two teams of seven players. To simplify things greatly, you use your hands to throw the ball into the opposing team's goal.\nFor handball's dedicated British fans, getting back in the Box at the Olympic Park has been a rare thrill.\n\"We're in our Wembley,\" says Paul Stewart, who plays for Ruislip Eagles and took part in one of Sunday's inaugural games.\n\"This is the pinnacle. You don't get to play in the biggest sports stadiums in football unless you're a pro. Every so often I look up from what looks like a gym floor and see these banks of seats, and remember - I'm in the Copper Box! Wow!\n\"I can see the seat I sat in at the Olympics.\"\nStewart was not a handball player this time 12 months ago, but he traded some water polo tickets with friends for the chance to see the sport and a love affair was born.\n\"We saw a double header in the group stage, Croatia-Spain and France-Sweden. The wow factor was there, watching these amazing goalkeepers.\n\"I went to my first session at the end of August last year, intending to be a goalkeeper, and the buzz was amazing.\n\"I remember getting home that evening and thinking: 'That was so much better than I'd imagined.' I was thinking I'd come home bruised or not even bruised because I hadn't touched the ball... but it was so much fun.\"\nFor Dani Sposi, setting foot inside the Copper Box is bittersweet. A former member of the British handball team, she narrowly missed out on selection for London 2012.\n\"During preparations for the Games we used to go there once a month,\" she remembers. \"When I got there, I remembered the smell, all those times we used to train there.\n\"Being there as a player after the Olympics was a bit emotional, because I wasn't selected and it was very hard to go through all that disappointment.\n\"I had my six-year-old son, Matteo, with me. He said: 'Mum, why didn't you play at the Olympics?' I said: 'Well, the coach made a different decision, so mummy didn't play.'\nDani Sposi: \"We had loads of people coming into the Copper Box on Sunday and asking about handball. We had another area in the arena where we could explain what handball is all about and let them shoot at goal.\n\"Sometimes people don't realise how hard handball is. Even the parents are like 'oh, I'll do it' - and then 'oh, this is hard!' You have to find the right co-ordination with the three steps and the bounce.\"\nPaul Stewart: \"We had easily hundreds, probably a couple of thousand people all told. There were points when it was massively busy, queues of parents with children all holding a ball waiting to have a go. It was superb.\n\"At league level, for the next year or so, it's going to be massive. If we get the right publicity, if people can see the sport and know it's still carrying on in the Olympic venue, that might drag them in across the country.\"\n\"He has been with me the whole journey, since he was eight months old - all the training sessions, travelling around. It was very good for him to be there, to go inside the Olympic arena. Even during training, I never had the chance to bring him in.\"\nSposi's dream of an Olympic appearance for Great Britain has ended, but other players in the Box still aspire to fly the British flag - despite a critical shortage of funding leaving GB's elite teams in limbo.\n\"Playing in the Olympic venue was a proud moment,\" says Gil Lewis, another who only started playing after London 2012.\nLewis already has two university team-mates who have been selected for the England Under-20 squad within a year of taking up the sport; he himself was chosen to play for the British universities team, but their trip to a tournament in the Netherlands fell apart when the travel proved too expensive.\nA shortage of cash is a feature of life as a handball player in Britain, but Lewis is determined not to let it dampen his enthusiasm.\n\"This year I've been invited to move up to the first team; I was in shock when I was first asked. They've asked if I want to go to the Challenge Cup, playing in Bulgaria, and that would be an amazing experience,\" he says.\n\"That all has to be funded through ourselves and it's a lot of personal expense to play. But an opportunity to play in a European competition? You don't want to miss out because you didn't save up enough.\"\nBritish teams competed at London 2012 by virtue of being the Olympic hosts. In future, they will have to qualify for the Games on merit, which is a big ask of a fledgling sport, but Lewis is determined to take the sport as far as he can.\n\"If a GB team is still around in the next few years, to be able to play for them would be fantastic,\" he says. \"If you'd told me a year ago, I'd never have imagined I'd be anywhere close to being able to represent my country.\n\"There will be a few years before I'm near that standard and with all the work being done at grassroots, by that time hopefully the standard will have improved enough to warrant some kind of funding - to at least put some form of team out.\"\nStewart adds: \"Outside the obvious problem with elite funding, we're in a very strong position to drive growth at youth level.\n\"At Ruislip, we're working hard to get together a full youth structure, plus I'm talking to local schools and colleges and we've got a tie-in with Brunel University.\n\"If we can get people into the sport, who knows what we can achieve?\"", "summary": "Last summer, the Copper Box played host to surprise smash-hit handball, a sport which engrossed unsuspecting British audiences.", "id": "23487664"}
{"document": "That was certainly the case when I met up with my friend Kerrie the other week and asked why she smelled of bliss on toast.\n\"Midnight Fantasy by Britney Spears,\" she replied.\nNow, I obviously appreciate Britney as pop royalty, but I was surprised such an arresting scent would have a celebrity's name attached to it.\nNot long ago, fragrances were associated with well-established, fashionable names such as Ralph Lauren or couture brands like Chanel.\nBut the number of celebrity perfumes on the market has rocketed in the last decade.\nWhy? Jennifer Lopez.\n\"Glow changed everything,\" says Chandler Burr, the former scent critic for the New York Times and author of several books on the subject.\nHe credits Lopez's first fragrance, which was released in 2002, with triggering a deluge of deodorants.\n\"Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive,\" he says.\nLopez had sparked what Jezebel brilliantly described as the \"scentocalpyse\".\nSuddenly, everyone and their goldfish had a scent of their own. And they sold by the truckload.\n\"Brands can see a huge surge in sales and awareness when a celebrity face resonates with their audience,\" says Gill Smith, managing director of The Perfume Shop.\nShe cites Beyonce and Ariana Grande's ranges as some of the store's most popular products.\nSo, what is the appeal of celebrity fragrances? \"Identification and intimacy,\" says Burr.\n\"Scent is an affordable unit of a star. Assuming the celebrity has actually been involved in its creation, a scent constitutes identification with that star viscerally and intimately. It is, in a small way, meeting them.\"\nPerfumes ideally have to match the celebrity's image while also appealing to their core audience (which explains why pop stars with younger fanbases have fragrances with sugary sweet smells).\nSmith says: \"We all still aspire to be more like our idols and connecting through a fragrance is one way of doing that.\n\"Britney Spears has stood the test of time. Diehard fans who wore Britney Fantasy over 12 years ago are still coming to us to try her new fragrances.\"\nThis is probably a good moment for me to make a confession. And, before I start, it's not something I'm proud of, ok?\nIt was August 2014. I'd been to Spain on holiday and was in the duty free section of Barcelona Airport.\nEarly, bored and trying to get rid of the last of my euros, I was spraying various aftershaves up and down my arm when one caught my nose.\nI looked at the bottle and was surprised to see it was something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas.\nSo I bought it, and was duly mocked by my friends for having spent money on something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas.\nBut it did make me realise that, if something smells good, it will sell regardless.\nFor celebrities who don't want to release a fragrance under their own name, the mere act of endorsing an existing brand can have a huge impact.\n\"Johnny Depp as the face of Dior Sauvage has helped to drive awareness for that fragrance,\" Smith says. \"Eighteen months after launch it's still one of our top 10 sales every day.\n\"Other examples include Gigi Hadid with Tommy Girl; Jared Leto with Gucci; and Estee Lauder Modern Muse with Kendall Jenner.\"\nShe adds: \"More recently the announcement of Guerlain working with Angelina Jolie has given a more traditional fragrance house a celebrity boost.\"\nThe stigma around celebrity fragrances may have faded over the last few years - but now the sales are fading as well.\nIt's a decline that started several years ago in the US.\n\"We saw it in 2008 right after the crash, and it's now a given in the US industry that the celebrity market has collapsed - or at least hugely shrunk,\" Burr explains.\n\"Rihanna and a few others have scents that are doing well, but it's nothing like before.\"\nConsumers in the UK appear to be turning their noses up at them too.\nFigures released by market research group National Purchase Diary (NPD) show sales of celebrity fragrances declined by \u00a312m in the UK last year - a drop of 22%.\nBut the fragrance market as a whole actually grew by 1.4% - so it's not that people stopped buying perfume, just that they're less drawn to celebrities.\nJust look at the sales of couture brands like Prada, Chanel and Dior, which collectively saw a 6% increase last year.\n\"The decline in celebrity perfumes is something we noticed in the past two years - it's not something we see normally,\" says Teresa Fisher, senior account manager in UK Beauty at NPD.\nThat drop, she points out, could partly be down to fewer launches.\n\"The market was very healthy a few years ago because there were a lot of celebrity fragrances around,\" Fisher says.\n\"We saw One Direction and James Bond scents generate market growth, but now we aren't seeing as many celebrity launches.\"\nThere might be fewer celebrities cologne-ising the shelves (sorry), but Smith says the market is still strong.\n\"It's definitely not the end of celebrity fragrance, we do still believe there is a place in the market for them,\" she says.\n\"Customers still want celebrity perfumes as long as it is the right celebrity, and the right scent.\"\nThe right scent, of course, is the crucial part.\nWhen he was the NYT's scent critic, Burr famously awarded Britney's Midnight Fantasy four stars, implying there should be no snobbery about celebrities if the smell itself is good.\nHe cites Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely as one of the best of the celebrity fragrances he came across and is now even developing his own, called You or Someone Like You.\nFisher says: \"I think overall what we're seeing is the polarisation of the fragrance market.\n\"At one end, consumers look for value for money, they go for promotions and maybe celebrity fragrances. But at the other, consumers are becoming more selective.\n\"Rather than buying 10 times a year maybe they buy five times a year.

HMIC has urged police chiefs to come up with a plan by the summer to attract, recruit and train more detectives.\nMs Billingham warned that while neighbourhood teams were the \"bedrock of British policing\" they were being \"chipped away... sometimes by stealth\".\nA survey of neighbourhood officers found they were being pulled from local duties at least once a week to supervise the detention or transport of suspects. A fifth of the officers said they could find themselves on other duties three times a week.\nOne police officer resigned last week after 13 years in the Devon and Cornwall, publishing a damning resignation letter on social media criticising police for \"putting their employees last\".\nDr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think I've ever read a report from the Inspectorate that was quite as sobering as this.\"\nDr Billings said there was \"no doubt\" that neighbourhood policing was under pressure, adding: \"I think that's true of my own area - because if people are really pressured to answer 999 calls, deal with incidents, they're going to pull officers out of neighbourhood areas.\"\nHe said HMIC's report reflects what is happening across the public sector.\n\"You can't get away from the fact that all of us are now trying to do more and better with less.\n\"And year on year, we're receiving less funding. Now of course a police force cannot run a deficit - so you have to make the books balance, and that leads sometimes to poor decisions.\"\nChief Constable Michael Barton of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said budgets had fallen by 22% in five years - leading to a loss of 32,000 officers and staff - at a time when many crimes were changing.\n\"It's a simple reality that we are required to prioritise more,\" he said. \"Difficult decisions are being made between resourcing neighbourhood teams, response units, specialist investigations and digital and cyber-enabled crime. There are no easy answers.\"\nMs Billingham said the failings were \"not simply about money\" because there was a huge variation in results, in particular in how well forces were winning the support of domestic violence victims in how they investigated and concluded cases.\nPolicing Minister Brandon Lewis said: \"This Government has protected police funding, through the 2015 spending review.\n\"There can be no excuse for any force that fails to deliver on its obligations.

{"document": "The  \n          eurozone group\n said reforms were Greece's \"best guarantee\" to overcome tough economic and social challenges.\nEuropean markets were mixed in morning trading, after Asia had recorded earlier gains.\nThe Syriza party, which rejected the bailout terms and came a close second, said it would lead the opposition.\nWith 99.9% of ballots counted, interior ministry results put New Democracy on 29.7% of the vote (129 seats), Syriza on 26.9% (71) and the socialist Pasok on 12.3% (33).\nThere are 300 seats in parliament and Greece has a rule that gives the leading party 50 extra seats.\nGreek voters had gone to the polls on Sunday following inconclusive elections in May.\nNew Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said Greeks had chosen to stay in the euro and called for a \"national salvation government\".\nBy Gavin HewittEurope editor\nIf Antonis Samaras is confirmed in power he will have a stronger opposition breathing down his neck. He will say to Europe that he has anchored Greece in the eurozone and wants something in return. That will be difficult.\nAlready German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has come out and said that the substance of the Greek reform bailout programme is non-negotiable. Where there might be some flexibility is over the timing of the implementation of reforms. There may also be some movement over interest rates on the loans and the EU might offer Greece some funds to boost growth.\nBut the message is clear; the austerity programme with its budget and spending cuts will stay.  The German finance minister underlined that message when he said: \"Greece's path will be neither short nor easy\".\nHe is now meeting President Carolos Papoulias, who is expected to give him the mandate to try to form a government.\nSyriza's leader Alexis Tsipras said his party would not take part in the government, and would instead become a powerful anti-austerity voice in the opposition.\nThe BBC's Mark Lowen, in Athens, says Mr Samaras is expected to try for a broad coalition, hoping to create a stable government with a stronger popular mandate.\nHe says Mr Samaras will push for a lightening of the bailout terms from Brussels, arguing that Greeks have accepted more pain by electing a pro-bailout party and that Europe should now cut Greece some slack.\nHowever, correspondents also point out that only 40% of voters backed parties that broadly support the bail-out deal with the EU and the IMF.\nTough austerity measures were attached to the two international bailouts awarded to Greece, an initial package worth 110bn euros (\u00c2\u00a389bn; $138bn) in 2010, then a follow-up last year worth 130bn euros.\nSunday's vote was watched around the world, amid fears that a Greek exit from the euro could spread contagion to other eurozone members and deepen the turmoil in the global economy.\nEuropean stock markets were mixed in morning trading. Asian shares had earlier advanced. Japan's Nikkei 225 index and South Korea's Kospi both closed up 1.8%.\nBBC business editor Robert Peston says the election results have been seen by investors as avoiding the worst short-term outcome, which would have been political paralysis followed by a messy exit from the euro.\nIn a statement on behalf of the 17 eurozone finance ministers, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Paul Juncker said that \"continued fiscal and structural reforms are Greece's best guarantee to overcome the current economic and social challenges and for a more prosperous future of Greece in the euro area\".\nElection as it happenedProfile: Antonis Samaras In pictures: Greek elections\nIn  \n          a joint statement\n European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also hailed the result, and expressed hope that a government would be formed quickly.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Mr Samaras to congratulate him on his victory.\nA German government statement said she had \"stated that she would work on the basis that Greece will meet its European commitments\".\nThe US stressed that it was in everyone's interests \"for Greece to remain in the euro area\".\nMr Samaras said that the Greek people had voted to stay in the eurozone.\n\"There is no time to waste,\" he said. \"A national salvation government must bring economic growth and reassure Greeks the worst is over.\"\nHe added: \"There will be no more adventures. Greece's place in Europe will not be put in doubt,\" promising that Athens would \"honour its obligations\".\nOur correspondent, Mark Lowen, says this suggests that Mr Samaras wants to press ahead with spending cuts demanded by the country's international creditors.\nEuropean leaders have warned that if the new Greek government rejects the bailout, the country could be forced to abandon the single currency.\nNew Democracy should be able to build a majority coalition with the socialist Pasok.\nHowever, coalition talks may not be easy.\nIn addition to Syriza's showing, four other parties which oppose or want a radical overhaul of the bailout look set to take between 60 and 70 seats. They include the far-right Golden Dawn, which has about 7% of the vote.\nThe leader of Pasok, Evangelos Venizelos, proposed a broad four-party coalition including New Democracy, Pasok, the Democratic Left and Syriza.\n\"No decision can be taken without this national unity,\" he said.", "summary": "World leaders have welcomed the narrow election victory of Greece's broadly pro-bailout New Democracy party and urged Athens to form a cabinet quickly.", "id": "18482415"}
{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nA beautifully controlled half-volley from Jonny Hayes after nine minutes was reward for a fine Dons start.\nBut Celtic were level within two minutes as Stuart Armstrong was given too much time to pick out the far corner from the edge of the box.\nLate Celtic pressure paid off as Rogic fired low past goalkeeper Joe Lewis.\nA thrilling 90 minutes concluded with Celtic not only lifting the cup for the first time since 2013 but becoming the first side in Scotland to complete an unbeaten treble.\nIt is the 37th time the Hoops have lifted the world's oldest national football trophy and the fourth time they have won the treble - and their first since 2001.\nDerek McInnes' Dons, looking to end a 27-year wait to win the competition for an eighth time, were left as runners-up to Brendan Rodgers' side in the Premiership, the League Cup and now the Scottish Cup.\nIt was a pulsating cup final right from the start, Aberdeen coming out with an edge to their play that put their illustrious rivals on the back foot.\nYes, Rodgers' team had won five out of five in the head-to-heads this season, with an aggregate score of 12-2, but this was an altogether different Dons to previous versions.\nIn this classic, they were a team reborn.\nIn the beginning, they harried Celtic's go-to men. Graeme Shinnie and Kenny McLean were commanding.\nThey lived in their faces defensively and showed plenty offensively. The feeling was that Aberdeen had to take the lead to make a true fight of this final and that is precisely what they did.\nHaving shipped three early goals to Celtic in their last meeting, the Dons changed the narrative.\nFrom a Niall McGinn corner, Hayes came round the blindside of Leigh Griffiths and smashed a volley past goalkeeper Craig Gordon and beyond Kieran Tierney on the line.\nIt was a goal of quality and a goal that electrified the huge Aberdeen support.\nCeltic are champions, though, and their true selves emerged only two minutes later when Aberdeen unwisely stood off Armstrong, who thumped in the equaliser low to Lewis's left.\nTwo early goals and the intensity only cranked up from there. Midway through the half, there was controversy.\nJayden Stockley - selected up front ahead of Adam Rooney - swung an arm into Tierney's face and the young Celtic full-back immediately signalled that he was in bother.\nBlood poured from his mouth and, after treatment, he had to leave the field.\nStockley has a reputation for over-zealous use of his arms and elbows and was deeply fortunate not to see red for a fourth time this season. He claimed it was accidental, but Celtic were having none of it. They were incensed.\nCallum McGregor shifted to left-back and Rogic came into the final and things went up another level.\nGordon made a double save in quick order and then made another from a Stockley header.\nCeltic were rattled, they were totally unable to get a hold of the game in the face of the Dons' aggressive edge.\nIt was Celtic, however, who should have gone ahead just before the break when a delicious Griffiths delivery was put over from point-blank range by Scott Sinclair.\nThe toe-to-toe nature of the contest carried on brilliantly. Griffiths and Sinclair went close then Aberdeen swept downfield on a breakaway and a priceless chance was wasted.\nHayes had mugged McGregor down the right and, with McLean running free in the box, all they had to do was get their communication right and a goal was certain.\nThey didn't. Hayes hit his pass slightly behind McLean and the midfielder couldn't hook it in. Agony for Aberdeen.\nCeltic then moved up a gear and now it was the Dons pinned on the ropes. Lewis pushed a Patrick Roberts shot on to his post.\nFrom the resulting corner, Celtic's Mikael Lustig tugged the ball just wide. The game opened up as wide as the Clyde.\nAberdeen's Ash Taylor headed away from under his own crossbar, Dedryck Boyota headed just over, Gordon made a fine save from Shinnie and then it was Lewis's turn again, saving wonderfully from Griffiths. Lewis was immense for the Dons.\nAs the final wore on, Celtic took an ever-tightening grip.\nRodgers' side pressed and pressed and a tiring Aberdeen threw their bodies in front of shots to keep alive. Their scrambling defence was constant and heroic.\nBut it wasn't enough. With all at Hampden steeling themselves for extra-time, Rogic ran at Aberdeen down the right, going past the utterly jaded Andrew Considine and slamming his shot low under Lewis. Extraordinary.\nThe heartbroken Dons had made it a mighty battle, but Celtic showed their incomparable will and their domestic greatness.\nThe history makers had done it again. A treble won.

On a recent trip to Israel's major annual security conference last week, many experts and officials there took the view that a bad deal, if properly implemented, might be better than no deal at all.\nWhat worries Israelis is the fact that Iran is now becoming a major player in the region.\nIts support for the Assad regime in Syria and the deployment of its allies - Hezbollah and various Shia militias, supported by officers from its Revolutionary Guard Corps - has provided Tehran with at least the opportunity to establish its allies on a long border with Israel from the Mediterranean Sea through Lebanon and Syria - all the way to the Jordanian frontier.\nJordan too is concerned, as are several of the Gulf states, which explains their quiet strategic rapprochement with Israel.\nThe irony in all of this is that it was largely US military power that established the conditions for Iran's rise to regional prominence.\nBy deposing its archenemy Saddam Hussein and reducing Iraq to a minor military player with many other security problems on its plate - Washington opened the door to the expansion of Iranian influence in the region.\nA further irony is that in supporting the Iraqi government's efforts against so-called Islamic State, the US is objectively allied with Tehran, with several Iranian-influenced Shia militias fighting in the same campaign.\nThe Obama administration's failure to countenance the forced removal of Syria's President Assad and its inept and half-hearted efforts to arm and train Sunni forces there, again favoured the emerging Shia axis.\nSo the Trump administration comes to office with a desire fundamentally to change Washington's stance towards Tehran. These sanctions are but the first step.\nA declaration that Iran is now \"on notice\", in the words of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, may sound good, but it doesn't amount to a policy.\nWhat real steps does the Trump team envisage?\nIs it ready to back - albeit reluctantly - the nuclear accord while monitoring stringently Iran's behaviour?\nWhat wider international support can the US gather for tougher action against Tehran's missile programme - which it insists it is entitled to pursue?\nOn the face of it here the US may have a point. UN Security council resolution 2231 calls on Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.\nA US National Security Council briefing earlier this week noted that ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a payload of at least 500kg to a range of 300km are inherently able to deliver nuclear weapons.\n\"There should be no doubt,\" the briefing went on , \"that the United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for adhering to missile restrictions and accountable for behaviour in the region that we consider to be destabilising.\"\nBut what exactly does the Trump Administration mean by phrases like \"holding Iran to account\"?\nThese are two countries whose warships potentially come into close proximity in Gulf waters every day. Tensions could spark a major confrontation. Is Washington on a collision course with Tehran?\nIts rhetoric might suggest so. But it is President Trump's actions - and of course Iran's own responses - that will determine where things go from here.", "summary": "Within days of an Iranian missile test and a subsequent warning from the Trump administration, the US has now followed up by imposing a new round of economic sanctions.", "id": "38859956"}
{"document": "That's the prospect facing parents in Knowsley on Merseyside.\nIf that was happening in green-wellied Oxfordshire or the sharp-elbowed London boroughs there would have been a storming of the barricades. Howls of anguish would be rattling the windows of the Department for Education.\nThere would be outrage about university places. Parents would want to know why their children had to fight for places in other authorities.\nThere would be warnings about social mobility going into reverse and a great leap backwards.\nBut in Knowsley the last school in the borough offering A-levels is planning to shut down its sixth form.\nThe governing body of Halewood Academy voted last month to close the sixth form, pending a consultation that finished at the weekend.\nThe academy says that its current sixth form is financially unviable.\nIt says that the break-even point is 155 sixth formers - and although in 2011-12 it had 157, since then the numbers have been below this level and as such it is no longer affordable.\nThe academy is proposing to stop taking new sixth formers from this autumn, with the assumption that pupils could travel to schools in other authorities.\nMany Knowsley pupils already go to schools in neighbouring authorities for their post-16 education, but it depends on such schools having places available.\nThe local authority says that as this is an academy, they can't intervene.\n\"As an academy, it receives its funding direct from government and not from Knowsley council.\n\"Whilst we, as the local authority, do work with all our local academies to help them improve education standards, as an academy the school is ultimately accountable to the regional school commissioner, and not the local council.\"\nParents have set up a protest page on Facebook, with comments about how difficult it is to get a clear answer from anyone about what is going on.\n\"Who is accountable? Nobody knows. Who do we get in touch with?\" says Vanessa Pointon, a parent at the school.\n\"This is letting down the children of this community. There are people who want to go to university, lots of kids who want to do well,\" she says.\nWhat kind of message does it send to young people to have no sixth forms offering A-levels?\nKnowsley already has among the lowest university entry rates in the country - and now young people are being told that none of their schools is even going to offer a single A-level.\nIt is hard to think that since A-levels were introduced in the 1950s that there has ever been an authority where none of its schools offered the qualification.\nSir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"It is important that young people have the opportunity to access a good choice of A-levels wherever they live.\n\"For social mobility and access to Russell Group universities, this often means academic subjects like physics, chemistry, further maths and languages.\"\nSir Peter said that despite funding challenges, it was \"crucial\" that \"such choices aren't curtailed\".\nThe Knowsley example raises questions about how a future school system could operate where all schools are autonomous academies.\nIf school decisions are outsourced to academy chains, who will provide an overview?\nThere will be six secondary schools in Knowsley, a mix of academies and local authority schools, and if Halewood's proposal goes ahead, none of them would offer A-levels.\nAcademy chains can operate across many different local authorities - and what works for them as a chain might not be the same as local interests.\nA Department for Education spokesman said ministers would be meeting MPs in Knowsley about the proposed sixth form closure.\nBut the department says that if the school wants to push ahead with closure it will still have to be approved by education officials.\n\"It must make the case to the Education Funding Agency and the regional schools commissioner that post-16 provision in the area would not be adversely affected by the closure before it can be given permission to close it.\"\nDoes this mean that the Department for Education will be able to intervene?\nThis is where things are far from clear.\nRegional schools commissioners, appointed by the government, are the officials responsible for overseeing academies. They can intervene if academies are underperforming or where their governance is weak.\nBut can they force an academy, or academy chain, to change what it teaches or the age groups?\nIt's a far-reaching question, because what if regional schools commissioners were allowed to intervene and decide on matters such as admissions policies? Could they subsidise a sixth form that an individual academy could not afford?\nCould they change how schools select or who they admit?\nIt's a political balancing act, because if they are bystanders, they will be dismissed as pointless. If they're given powers to intervene, including in good and outstanding schools, they will be attacked as bureaucrats trampling on parents' rights.\nThe Education Select Committee has warned of a lack of clarity about the role of the regional schools commissioner and that they risked being seen as \"undemocratic and opaque\".\nThey heard evidence that nine out of 10 parents did not understand what commissioners were meant to be doing.\n\"As we move towards a system of full academisation, the role of regional school commissioners will continue to grow and evolve,\" says the Department for Education.\nThe government, setting out plans to compel all schools to become an academy, has called its White Paper \"Educational Excellence Everywhere\".\nBut parents facing the prospect that none of their local schools will allow their children to take A-levels must wonder if \"everywhere\" means somewhere else.", "summary": "How could there be an entire local authority in England where no pupil can take an A-level?", "id": "36046503"}

{"document": "For months she's resisted closing her country's borders and setting an upper limit on the number of asylum seekers allowed into Germany despite rising, and at times frantic, public and political pressure to do so, including from within her own CDU party.\nIron Angie - as she's sometimes known at home - demonstrated her unwavering determination once again at yesterday's EU-Turkey summit and in the lead-up to it.\nThere have been dark mutterings in the German media that, despite increasing problems at home linked to the arrival of over a million asylum-seekers, the German chancellor has spent more time in Ankara than Aachen, Berlin or Cologne of late.\nBut there was stubborn purpose behind the shuttling.\nMrs Merkel's political future - and her legacy, after a decade as German chancellor - are hanging in the balance.\nShe faces three key regional elections this weekend, with polls predicting huge gains for the anti-immigrant AfD party.\nShe needed something big and bold on migration, allowing her to avoid performing an awkward U-turn on her national policies but at the same time sending a clear message to the people of Germany that she has the situation in hand.\nMake no mistake - it was Germany and no other European nation that insisted on a summit with Turkey this week.\nTurkey is key to resolving Europe's current migration chaos. That's where most refugees and others jump on board people smugglers' dinghies, risking their lives to enter Europe via the Greek islands.\nBut trust between Turkey and the EU is not strong. An \"action plan on migration\" between the two back in November failed to yield many results.\nThere has been little sign of Turkey cracking down on people-smugglers along its coastline, and limited evidence of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3bn (\u00c2\u00a32.3bn; $3.3bn) the EU then promised Turkey in humanitarian aid.\nSo Mrs Merkel began a new push for what she hoped would be a better Turkish deal.\nDonald Tusk, the head of the European Council, which represents all EU member countries in Brussels, joined in the efforts (after all, he would be the summit host), flying to Turkey ahead of Monday's meeting.\nBut neither of these seasoned politicians were quite prepared for what is now being described as a \"Turkish bazaar\" here in Brussels.\nTurkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu arrived at the summit all smiles for the cameras.\n\"Turkey is ready to work with the European Union,\" he beamed - omitting to say at what price.\nThen, behind closed doors, he slammed the EU with a whole host of additional political and funding demands:\nEven a few months ago, my bet is that faced with this steep list of demands, EU countries would simply have turned their back and walked out.\nNot now.\nChancellor Merkel isn't the only one desperate to solve the migrant crisis: The EU's credibility is crumbling, its members have never looked less unified and Greece, stuck with tens of thousands of stalled migrants on top of being saddled with crippling euro debt repayments, threatens to implode.\nThe bottom line, for the EU, is to put off anybody and everybody from getting in dinghies or trying any means possible to get to Europe to improve their lives. It hopes to send every economic migrant back home and to pay to look after refugees in camps closer to theirs.\nVoters across Europe say they are spooked by the migrant crisis. But however much Europe's leaders and EU bosses in Brussels fear for their future, they can't compromise all their principles trying to make this problem \"go away\".\nAnd that is why last night's summit didn't end in a deal. Of course, triumphant words flew out of the mouths of leaders and broadcasters across Europe - \"turning point\", \"Big Bang\" and \"breakthrough\".\nBut that is only if - and it's a big if - the proposals are written up and signed at another migrant summit next week - and \"if\" they are then implemented.\nThere's a lot to think about.\nCan the EU afford to close its eyes to the Turkish president's increasingly autocratic and arguably anti-democratic behaviour in its rush to do a migration deal?\nJust before the summit, the Turkish government took over one of the country's best-selling newspapers and tear-gassed outraged protesters on the streets of Ankara, for example.\nAnd what of the legal implications of the EU exporting migrants en masse back to Turkey?\nThe UN has warned this could go against international humanitarian law, with some asylum cases needing to be heard here in Europe, they say. Turkey does not have asylum laws in place for Afghans and Iraqis for example, so what will happen to those migrants?\nAnd then there are the logistical challenges.\nImagine the scenes - not just young men, but old women, wheelchair users, pregnant mothers and screaming babies, many from Syria and other troubled areas. After all they've been through to to get to Greece, will they meekly accept getting on a boat or plane to be sent back to Turkey?\nAnd these are just some of the complications surrounding an EU-Turkey deal, never mind the splits in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis.\nSo, on Monday Angela Merkel got what she needed for her weekend elections: a tough-sounding something with the promise of a Turkey deal in the offing.\nConveniently for her, the votes will be counted in Germany before the talk from the summit begins to publicly unravel.", "summary": "\"Where there's a will, there's a way,\" Angela Merkel has insisted since the migration crisis exploded across Europe last year.", "id": "35755331"}

If no candidate achieves that mark, then a simple majority is required in the second round.\nIf there is still no winner, then a third round will take place, minus the candidate with the fewest votes in round two.\nFifa says a winner must be declared on Friday because an ice hockey rink is due to be installed at the Hallenstadion venue at midnight.\nSo determined is Fifa to get this election done that it has spent \u00a3500,000 converting its headquarters into a back-up venue.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGiven everything that has happened to Fifa, this is seen as a pivotal moment for an organisation which has been heavily criticised for its lack of transparency and for failing to clamp down on corruption within it.\nA new leader, together with a raft of reform measures, is seen as a chance to start afresh.\nActing president Issa Hayatou said Friday can \"signal a new dawn\", adding: \"This is our opportunity to show we are united in building a stronger Fifa.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThere have been widespread allegations of corruption, the arrest of leading officials, the banning of its president and the sight of big-name sponsors deserting the organisation.\nNumerous Fifa officials have been indicted in the United States, while Swiss authorities are also investigating the organisation.\nBlatter has also been banned from all football activity for six years after being found guilty of breaching Fifa's ethics rules over a $2m (\u00a31.3m) \"disloyal payment\" to the head of European football's governing body Uefa, Michel Platini, who had been favourite to succeed the Swiss.\nFormer France captain Platini was also suspended. Both men deny any wrongdoing and are appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nFurthermore, Jerome Valcke, Fifa's secretary general and formerly Blatter's right-hand man, was banned for 12 years following allegations - which he denies - of misconduct while in office.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFifa's leader is the figurehead for world football, often seen in public alongside presidents, prime ministers and royalty.\nThere have been eight of them so far, presiding over the organisation's executive committee, which is where the real decision-making power lies.\nFifa organises World Cups and other international tournaments, distributes broadcasting rights and should both protect and develop the world's most popular sport.\nThe president also \"legally represents\" the organisation, \"maintains relations between Fifa and the confederations, members, political bodies and international organisations\", and \"implements the decisions passed by the congress and the executive committee\".\nThere are five candidates, from Africa, Europe and the Middle East:\nPrince Ali bin al-Hussein\nJerome Champagne\nGianni Infantino\nSheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa\nTokyo Sexwale\nRead more: the five candidates profiled\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPrince Ali: \"I'm a candidate beholden to no one.

I have come this far.\"\nPrince Ali wants to quadruple the amount Fifa's member associations receive - believing it will increase their sustainability - but wants the money properly accounted for.\nInfantino would expand the World Cup to 40 teams to ensure more smaller nations can participate. He also wants to hugely expand Fifa's development plan by investing \u00a3860m of its revenues and giving \u00a33.6m to each member association.\nSheikh Salman's big idea is to split Fifa in two with a business side handling commercial issues and the football side organising World Cups and developing the game. He believes this would stop executives making self-interested decisions.\nChampagne's most recent manifesto, Hope For Football, emphasised \"rebalancing\" the inequality in football and \"reconciling\" the game's \"protagonists\". He wants to modernise - by introducing technology to help referees, having women in key Fifa roles and run Fifa like a public sector organisation.\nSexwale has focused on his background in administration in the election run-up. His manifesto headline was the idea to put sponsors on national teams shirts to help raise money for the football associations.\nSheikh Salman is the front runner because he has the backing of his own Asian confederation, as well as Africa.\nThe continents do not vote as a block and the ballot is held in secret.\nBut such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated and may not be hard to deny.\nInfantino, who is effectively in charge of European football following the suspension of Uefa president Platini.\nThe 45-year-old has, according to his camp, made gains in recent weeks and they believe he is the man to beat.\nOn Thursday, Infantino told BBC Sport he was expecting 105 out of 207 votes in the first round - the same as Salman predicts for himself.\nUefa's general secretary has strong support in Europe and South America, as well as significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean and his camp also thinks he will get half the votes in Africa.\nIf those predictions prove true, he will win.\nPrince Ali lost out to Blatter in last year's election and looks like missing out again after failing to make gains after Platini was banned.\nHowever, if he does drop out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate he could still be an important influence in deciding the eventual winner.\nAs for Champagne and Sexwale, who is a former political prisoner on South Africa's Robben Island, they are the rank outsiders.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe delegates are also being asked to agree to reforms designed to end the problems that have led to Fifa's crisis in recent months and restore the organisation's reputation.\nSpecifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries.\nAnother proposal is to disband Fifa's executive committee and replace it with a 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women.\nGreg Dyke, who will cast a vote as chairman of the Football Association, says the reforms are \"more important\" than the new leader as it will provide an \"opportunity for Fifa to start again\".\nBBC sports editor Dan Roan in Zurich:\n\"Few fans or players would recognise these individuals, let alone know about their policies or have trust in their leadership.\n\"The selection of Sepp Blatter's successor should be the moment the governing body finally consigns the tainted tenure of their former president to history, and symbolically moves on from the stranglehold he held over the organisation for so long.\n\"Except to many, it simply does not feel like that.\n\"All of the men running for president are members of the football establishment.

Some were banging on the windows and shouting \"Germany, Germany.\"\nFollow our live updates\nEU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives.\nMany of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum.\nNothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across.\nThere were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting \"Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear.\nAnd then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting \"help! help!\" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions.\nInternational services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely.

In fact, because the rest of the team are used to a 3-4-2-1, I don't see it being a massive problem at all.\nThe key area on Saturday for Arsenal is not their defence, or their attack - which is very strong.

At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now.\"\n1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army\n2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict\n2008: Head of US Central Command\n2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan\nMid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director\nNovember 2012: Resigns over affair\nAfter commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.\nSubsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge.\nBut despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years.\nHe was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.\nHe also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.\nNot surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.\nThe keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.\n\"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,\" he said.  \"You have to have that political component as well.\"\nPolitical change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, \"the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it\".\nAs to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.\n\"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,\" he insists.\n\"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.\"\nThat looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.\n\"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?\" he asks. \"Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?\n\"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?\"\nIt sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension.\n\"Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?\"\nIn response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.\n\"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans.\"\nGen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements.

{"document": "The Banking Standards Commission wants the government to \"electrify\" the fence so banks won't try to \"game\" the rules.\nThat means regulators having the power to fully break up a bank if it does not follow the ring-fence proposals.\nThe bank reforms will go before Parliament early next year.\nThe Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, known as the Banking Commission for short, was asked by Chancellor George Osborne to study the draft version of the government's Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill.\nThis follows last year's recommendation by the Independent Commission on Banking, which was led by Sir John Vickers.\nSir John concluded that ring-fencing was the best way to protect \"core\" retail banking activities from any future investment banking losses, such as were seen during the global financial crisis.\nBanking reform: What has changed since the crisis?\nThe government's proposed bill hinged on three main aspects:\nBut the government's draft legislation was a watered-down version of the Vickers report which proposed quite a high degree of separation, said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Banking Standards Commission.\n\"The proposals as they stand [in the Bill], fall well short of what is required,\" he said.\n\"What we've done with the Commission proposals is to put back some of that stiff separation into the ring-fence and then make clear that the key problem - that banks are going to be at the ring-fence all the time, which will be a nightmare for regulators - needs to be dealt with,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"And the way to do that is to say to banks 'If you don't try to game this ring-fence we won't see the need to separate you.'\n\"Then they will have a massive incentive to get to a point where banks have certainty [not to be broken up].\"\n\"That is why we recommend electrification. The legislation needs to set out a reserve power for separation - the regulator needs to know he can use it.\"\nUnder the draft bill, ring-fencing would ensure that retail services of a struggling lender can be carried on independently and smoothly even if authorities let the rest of the group fail.\nFor example, in the case of a failing banking group, regulators could sell off its core activities - thereby maintaining continuity for depositors - while allowing the rest of the organisation to go through a bankruptcy process.\nSecondly, retail deposits (but not pension liabilities) would be ranked ahead of the claims of other bank creditors in the event of a bank insolvency.\nThirdly, banks are to hold a sufficient capital buffer - as outlined by global regulators - which means that if banks do fail, losses can be absorbed by shareholders and other creditors rather than the taxpayer.\nRing-fenced banks would also be prohibited from carrying out a range of investment and wholesale banking activities, including the sale of complex derivatives, which are highly complicated contracts designed to hedge borrowers against certain risks but can lead to heavy losses if they go sour.\nBut in a concession, the Banking Commission proposal agreed to the use of simple derivatives, such as currency hedges, for banks within the ring-fenced body.\nUnder the draft legislation, the Treasury would have the authority to decide which banks ring-fencing should apply to, as well as specific activities to be undertaken within ring-fenced banks.\nThe Prudential Regulation Authority, which will become the UK's regulator for deposit-taking institutions in April under the Bank of England, would have the power to ensure the ring-fenced bank to carry on with its business.\nMr Tyrie has also called on independent reviews of the effectiveness of the ring-fence proposals across all banks to take place at least once every four years.\n\"Remember at the moment banks will probably behave, but in the long run they will find a way to gaming the ring-fence if they don't have a strong disincentive to do so,\" he told the BBC.\n\"In 10-20 years time... people will get complacent. At that point it's crucial to have a set of rules to keep banks well away from testing this ring-fence.\"\nShadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"As Ed Miliband and I said at the Labour conference this year, if the letter and spirit of the Vickers proposals are not delivered and we do not see cultural change in our banks, full separation will be necessary.\n\"The Commission is clearly right to say the jury is still out and to demand a reserve power for full separation of the banks.\"\nThe Commission's report comes a month after Mr Osborne urged its members not to send the government's proposed reform \"back to square one\" by \"unpicking\" the consensus on how it should be carried out.\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable, who has often been at loggerheads with Mr Osborne over how tough banking reforms should be, said: \"I think we originally came out at it from opposite directions, but we've come to a common view that the ring-fencing solution is the best way forward.\"\n\"I think he [George Osborne] is quite right to say the last thing we want is to create more uncertainty,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, the banking industry was less enthusiastic about the proposals, saying lingering uncertainty about the future shape of the banking industry threatened banks' ability to lend and to compete.\n\"The risk here is creating uncertainty,\" Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), told the BBC.\n\"If it's perpetually hanging over the banking sector that individual banks or the whole sector could be broken up at some point, then it's going to be difficult to return to having an investable banking sector that can be customer-focused and globally competitive and do what it should be doing, which is lending to homeowners and businesses.\"\nMark Field, a Conservative MP whose constituency includes the City of London, also warned of the dangers of uncertainty hanging over the banking sector. He said the 2019 deadline for banks to fully implement the reforms - as the Vickers report proposed - needed to be brought forward.\nMr Cable said the government wanted to \"crack on with it\".\n\"We want to make sure that by the end of this parliament we have something proper in place,\" he said.\n\"But if there are good proposals coming from parliamentarians to deal with the strengthening of the ring-fence - as Sir John said it has to be effective, that's the whole point of it - then we obviously will have to look at that.\"", "summary": "Government plans to ring-fence the banks - protecting retail banking from the riskier investment side - \"fall well short of what is required\", a report has warned.", "id": "20803548"}

{"document": "Victory in the Cold War made it the hegemon in a unipolar world.\nFew argued when the 20th Century was dubbed the \"American Century\", a term first coined in the early 1940s when the country was still overcoming its isolationist instincts.\nEven the New Year's fireworks, which illuminated the obelisk of the Washington Monument in a way that made it resemble a giant number one, projected the country's supremacy as the world's sole superpower.\nOver the past 15 years, America's fortunes have changed with dizzying speed.\nFirst came the tremors: the dot-com bust and a disputed presidential election in 2000. Then came the massive convulsions: the destruction of the Twin Towers in 2001 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\nLong wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have exacted an enormous blood price - the lives of 6,852 American military personnel - not to mention immense financial expense, estimated to be as high as $6 trillion (\u00c2\u00a33.9tn).\nThe detention centre at Guantanamo Bay has undermined American ideals, just as the NSA and Wikileaks spying scandals have undercut American diplomacy.\nGeorge W Bush, a president with a Manichean worldview, was widely seen as over-eager to project America's military might, without adequately considering the long-term consequences.\nBarack Obama, who campaigned in 2008 on a platform of extricating America from its unpopular and exhausting wars, has drawn criticism for disengaging too much.\nUnder both presidents - the first an impulsive unilateralist, the second an instinctive multilateralist content sometimes to lead from behind - America's global standing has been diminished.\nPolls regularly show that Americans recognise that their country's international standing has waned.\nAmong the young, this trendline has fallen sharply. Only 15% of 18-29-year-olds believe that America is the \"greatest country in the world\", according to Pew, down from 27% in 2011.\nTellingly, however, there has been no great public outcry.\nNo longer is there much appetite for America playing its long-standing role of global policeman, even in the face of the rise of the group calling itself Islamic State.\nThe cost, human and financial, is considered too great. Americans increasingly think that other countries should share the burden.\nObama, while continuing to trumpet \"American exceptionalism\", regularly prefaces remarks on foreign affairs by acknowledging the limits of US power, again with little public outcry.\nThe upshot is that the United States is no longer so keen to exert leadership in an increasingly messy world.\nYet one of the reasons why the world has become so disorderly is because America is no longer so active in imposing order.\nOver the course of this century Washington has lost its fear factor.\nWorld leaders nowadays seem prepared to provoke the wrath of the White House, confident that it will never rain down on them.\nIt explains why the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, after unleashing chemical weapons against his people, continues to bombard them with barrel bombs.\nWhy Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, and also offered a safe haven for the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nAnd also why Benjamin Netanyahu thumbed his nose at the Obama administration, by accepting an invitation from the Republican congressional leadership to address a joint session of Congress, a platform he used to lambast the Iran nuclear deal.\nAssad's flouting of American warnings is especially noteworthy.\nIn killing so many civilians with chemical weapons, he flagrantly crossed the \"red line\" imposed by Obama, but escaped punishment.\nThe president was unwilling to carry through on an explicit threat, in what was the biggest foreign policy climbdown of his presidency and also one of the most significant in the past 50 years.\nEven supporters of Barack Obama believe he made a fatal strategic mistake, because it demonstrated endless flexibility and a lack of American resolve.\nNeedless to say, despots around the world took note.\nAmerica's reluctance to launch new military actions has also had a major bearing on the nuclear negotiations with Iran.\nTehran has managed to extract notable concessions, such as the ongoing ability to enrich uranium, hitherto ruled out by the Americans.\nIt has played a weak hand strongly, because it knows that America has what the foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman calls \"an empty holster\".\nNor is it just America's enemies who no longer fear the White House to the extent they once did.\nIn recent months, two close allies, Britain and Australia, have defied the Obama administration by joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\nBy signing up to the AIIB, they are effectively endorsing Beijing's effort to establish financial rivals to the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are dominated by America.\nBy seeking improved commercial and diplomatic relations with China, Britain and Australia are also hedging.\nThey suspect that America will not be the dominant Pacific military power indefinitely, nor the world's foremost economic powerhouse.\nOther American allies would complain that the \"dependability factor\" has also gone.\nIsrael feels badly let down by the Obama administration over the Iran deal, and relations between Benjamin Netanyahu and Barack Obama are poisonous.\nThe president, by using deliberately ambiguous language, has even signalled that his administration might end its traditional protection of Israel at the United Nations.\nLike Israel, Saudi Arabia has been enraged by the prospective nuclear deal with the Iranians.\nRiyadh also knows that America is no longer so dependent on its oil, the cornerstone of the relationship since the end of World War Two.\nEgypt was angered in 2012 when Obama said Cairo was neither an ally nor an enemy.\nLater, the State Department issued an embarrassing correction, and reinstated Cairo as a \"major non-Nato ally.\"\nMaybe Obama's Egyptian error, and the slight it conveyed, was truly a Freudian slip.\nAfter all, he hasn't invested the same energy nurturing alliances as his predecessors. The detached air that has been a hallmark of his presidency also extends to foreign affairs.\nHere, I gather, Obama recognises intellectually that he could do far more in terms of massaging the egos of world leaders, but cannot quite bring himself to do so.\nIndeed, a common complaint is that the Obama administration has prioritised normalising relations with its one-time enemies, Iran and Cuba, at the expense of fostering longstanding friendships.\nRealising that America is no longer so supportive, and no longer so engaged in the Middle East, the Saudis have recently taken military action of their own in Yemen.\nThere's also been a warming of relations between Riyadh and Moscow.\nAnd Egypt launched airstrikes in February against the Islamic State group in Libya.\nAmerica's standing in the Middle East has unquestionably waned, along with its ability to shape events.\nMore surprising has been its slippage in Africa, Obama's ancestral home, and Asia, the focus of his much vaunted pivot.\nIn Asia, America's median approval rating in 2014, as measured by Gallup, was 39%, a 6% drop since 2011.\nIn Africa, the median approval went down to 59%, the lowest since polling began, despite Obama hosting the US-Africa Leaders' Summit in Washington in August, last year.\nIt even dropped in Kenya, his father's birthplace.\nAmerica's diplomacy has also been complicated by the dysfunction and hyper-partisanship in Washington.\nRepublican lawmakers actively sought to derail the Iran nuclear deal by sending a letter to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nHouse speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to address Congress, knowing it would infuriate the White House.\nDemocrats with reservations about free trade have tried to sabotage the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal since Nafta.\nThere's also been strong congressional opposition to one of the big plays of Obama's second term, the rapprochement with Cuba.\nShould countries listen to the president or Congress?\nAmerica cannot even lay claim any more to its great, uncontested boast since 1872, of being the world's largest economy.\nThe IMF now estimates that China's economy is fractionally bigger.\nYet it would be a mistake to exaggerate the downsizing of American influence.\nUS military spending continues to dwarf its rivals, and up until last year amounted to more than the next 10 countries combined.\nIn 2014, America spent $731bn, compared to China's $143bn.\nEven though China's economy is now larger, America's per capita spending power is in a different league - $53,000 to $11,868.\nThough America is contending with the rise of the rest - China, India, Brazil, Germany and Russia - it has not yet been overtaken by emergent rivals.\nIndeed, there are foreign policy thinkers here who predict that America will preserve its pre-eminence for at least another 20 years.\nYet the unipolar moment ushered in by the fall of the Berlin Wall has proved to be just that: momentary.\nMoreover, hopes of a new world order following the collapse of the Soviet Union have given way to widespread pessimism about the spread, even the contagion, of global disorder.\nGone are the certainties of America's Cold War thinking, when the containment of communism governed its international actions.\nGone are the doctrines that gave US foreign policy such a rigid frame, throughout the Cold War and in the aftermath of 9/11.\nGone, too, is the notion that every fight is an American fight and along with it a redefinition of what constitutes the US national interest.\nBarack Obama has instead advocated pragmatism and diplomatic dexterity, trying to steer a path between America being overextended and undercommitted.\nMaybe the overriding challenge for US diplomacy over the next 20 years is to strike the proper balance.", "summary": "Standing on the Washington Mall at the turn of the new millennium, it was impossible not to be struck by America's power and global pre-eminence.", "id": "33440287"}
{"document": "That's how David Miliband, who heads the International Rescue Committee, recently phrased two pressing goals for Syria.\nOn Monday, as a second round of peace talks gets under way in Geneva, both the worsening war and a grave humanitarian crisis will be on the agenda again.\nFor much of the first round, UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi expressed anguish over the failure of warring sides to agree, at the very least, a humanitarian ceasefire in the embattled city of Homs.\nThen, a few days after talks broke up, the UN announced a \"humanitarian pause\" had finally been reached between government and opposition forces.\nSuffering of Syrian Palestinians\nIn pictures: Escaping besieged Homs\nOver the past three days, a temporary truce allowed more than 600 women, children and the elderly to escape the ruins of a shattered Old City which has been in rebel hands, under siege by government forces, for nearly two years.\nYoung men who left the area were taken in for questioning by Syrian forces.  Their fate is still not clear.\nBut the joint aid convoy of the UN and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society (SARC) still came under mortar and gunfire when it entered the area with food and medicine to ease the suffering of starving people. More than 15 aid workers were pinned down, unable to exit, for hours.\n\"All the devils in this crisis will always try to hinder our work,\" regretted SARC's head of operations Khaled Erksoussi, on a telephone line from Damascus with a voice tinged with exhaustion and anger.\n\"We have to be stubborn and not lose hope about getting aid to the people in need,\" he emphasised.\nBadly needed food distribution has also started in the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk in Damascus which has been cut off for many months.  But Christopher Gunness, spokesman for the UN's Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said  the operation has had to be suspended because of clashes close to the distribution area.\nSuch is the sad reality of the existential battle in Syria.  Everything -  even daily bread and innocent children - are weapons in this war.\nIf there are, to use Mr Erksoussi's phrase, \"devils in this crisis\", there are also few angels. All sides are putting civilian populations in harm's way to press for advantage on the battlefield.\nVideos and eyewitness accounts point to attacks by pro-government forces in the latest violence in Homs but Syrian officials put the blame on \"terrorists\" and infighting among rebel forces.\nThere is still no recognition on the ground of that mantra repeated endlessly outside Syria that \"there is no military solution to this crisis\".\nThat is what makes the prospects for success in the Geneva talks still so slim.\nLike these aid operations, negotiations will be a tortuous process of small steps forward, and big lurches backward.\n\"Its very good that it is taking place but I am sad to report there is no progress,\" admitted a grim-faced Mr Brahimi at the Munich Security Conference only hours after the first round ended in Geneva.\n\"It's not often that you hear diplomats being so honest about failure,\" remarked one observer in the audience. He then added, only partly in jest: \" You have to admit there is a certain quality to it.\"\nWhen the stakes are so high, and the damage in Syria so deep, there is no purpose in pretending the reality is any different.\nAnd yet, the talks were not for naught.  Two warring sides, who speak only with contempt of each other, occasionally sat in the same room that week.  Much of the \"talks\" was talking past each other, or through Mr Brahimi.\nBut the hope is that, over time, individuals will start listening to a starkly different narrative of the war coming from their enemy.\nNo-one expects progress to be made any time soon on the main overarching goal in this process - the establishment of a \"transitional governing body\" set out in the \"Geneva I\" document that underpins the negotiations.\nSyrian government officials declare that President Bashar al-Assad is there to stay unless elections or a referendum decide otherwise. The opposition insists there can be no future for Syria that includes him.\nIn the meantime, pressure mounts for progress on the other goal that is not formally part of this process . To use David Miliband's phrase, it is how to bring \"humanity to the conduct of the war\".\nA new global coalition of aid agencies and human rights groups is taking shape to give louder voice to demands for local ceasefires, aid corridors, and a United Nations Security Council resolution on humanitarian issues alone.\nIn recent months, under pressure from allies and aid officials, the Syrian government has been giving more visas to aid workers and has agreed to  limited access in some besieged areas.\nBut there are still many more places and people who urgently need aid. The UN estimates about a quarter of a million Syrians are in desperate need in besieged or hard to reach areas.\nSyria's humanitarian crisis needs, most of all, a political solution.

{"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nJean-Marc Bosman did not trademark any moments of skill, score famous late winners or carry his teams to success but he was good enough to win 20 youth caps for Belgium and break into the first team of one of his country's best clubs at 18.\nThat, however, is not what earns him a place alongside Charlemagne, Audrey Hepburn and Hercule Poirot in a list of famous Belgians.\nTwenty years ago on Tuesday, Bosman emerged from the European Court of Justice with a win that turned Europe's top divisions into glorious expressions of multiculturalism and added a new noun to sport's lexicon: the Bosman.\nFrom that moment, players at the end of their contracts - David Beckham, Sol Campbell, Steve McManaman and many more - could move without a transfer fee.\nNo longer would a player from the European Union have their opportunities in the single market curtailed by rules limiting the number of foreigners clubs could field.\nBut for this softly spoken 51 year old, it was a case that almost ruined him.\n\"There have been real problems but I am feeling much better now,\" said Bosman when I asked him how he was after a spell in prison, bankruptcy and a long battle with alcoholism.\n\"I've had medical and psychological care and I also have blood samples taken on a regular basis.\n\"There have been difficulties and my financial situation is not easy but life has started over. I have regained strength and feel motivated.\n\"It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end.\"\nHe entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary.\nYet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they'd paid for him in the first place.\n\"It was illogical,\" said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a \"freedom fighter\".\nHis lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career.\nBanned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners.\nHe had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football's business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen.\nBroke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out.\nThere was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer's son did so) and problems with the taxman.\nIn 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013.\nIt was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not.\n\"I was young and handsome then and I now have become old,\" he explained.\n\"Most of the players won't be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive.\n\"I may not be here in 20 years' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!\"\nI am speaking to him at Fifpro's swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation's campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely.\nThe best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players.\nThe players won Bosman but were \"ambushed\", in the words of Fifpro's general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game's governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant \"player power\".\nThis deal was enshrined in Fifa's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001.\nThese rules set out today's transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs.\nFive years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster's move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back.\nThe details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed.\nThis really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player's replacement cost.\nPlayers such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer.\nQuite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player's right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club's right to stability and a league's competitive integrity on the other.\nEverton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation.\n\"The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely,\" said Martinez last week.\n\"Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now.\n\"But it wouldn't be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important.\"\nBut Fifpro's Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players' position, as well as being unfounded in truth.\nDr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001.\nAccording to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents.\nHe also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors.\n\"We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn't,\" explained Van Seggelen.\n\"In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people 'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?'\n\"You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that.\"\nThat might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the \"Bosman ruined football\" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded.\n\"Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money,\" said Van Seggelen.\n\"We're not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong.\n\"I don't know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues.\n\"Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It's an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law.\"\nBy this point, Bosman is outside smoking.\nDespite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company.\nHe does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys.\nHis main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship.\n\"Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don't want to complicate their lives with it, they've just left kindergarten,\" he said.\n\"But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good.\n\"Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans.\n\"Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that's it! This is the Bosman ruling, and we ought to get back to it.\"", "summary": "A Cruyff turn, Fergie time, the Matthews final: football's icons have often entered the language of the sport but can any of those greats claim to have changed the game as much as the nervous, middle-aged Belgian sitting in front of me?", "id": "35097223"}
{"document": "In addition to original versions of the games, Halo: The Master Chief collection will also include a new visually-upgraded version of Halo 2.\nPurchasers of the November release are also being promised \"beta\" access to the multiplayer version of the forthcoming Halo 5.\nOne company watcher said it illustrated the firm was listening to its fans.\n\"I think it's a smart move,\" said David Scarborough, from GamesTM magazine.\n\"It shows a willingness to satiate the appetite of Xbox hardcore gamers, which is what Microsoft sees the Halo franchise as - it's biggest hardcore gaming franchise.\n\"It also feeds into the hype for the next entry in the series.\n\"But I personally don't think it will be something that will incentivise people who haven't yet bought a new console to buy an Xbox One.\"\nXbox gamers who already bought the titles on earlier versions of the Xbox are being given an added reason to buy the games again: the package will also include access to watch a new live-action series called Halo: Nightfall.\nThe episodes, produced by Ridley Scott, are currently being filmed in Ireland, and are separate to the Steven Spielberg Halo TV series promised last year.\nWhile new pre-rendered trailer footage of Halo 5 was shown to the audience at the firm's E3 press conference in Los Angeles, developer 343 Studios was not yet ready to demo gameplay or confirm a launch date.\nXbox chief Phil Spencer told the crowd at the Microsoft event  that Halo was the \"reason Xbox is here today\".\nHe also acknowledged that his firm had changed its strategy to take account of customer feedback - a nod to it abandoning restrictions on the sale of second-hand disks and releasing a cheaper version of the console without its Kinect voice/camera sensor.\nHe pointedly said at the event's outset that this year's conference would be dedicated exclusively to showing off new games, rather than sharing the time to show off other multimedia features.\nMicrosoft's rival Sony had exploited previous attempts to promote the Xbox as both a games machine and a means to control cable TV, pitching the PlayStation 4 as the machine for serious gamers. That move helped the Japanese company to enjoy stronger sales since both machines launched last November.\nOther new titles on show for the Xbox One included the hyper-reality game Sunset Overdrive, which features a character who skids across rails blowing up people who have been turned into mutants by a poisonous fizzy drink.\nThe colourful game is an Xbox One exclusive and due out later this year.\nMicrosoft Game Studios showed off another new Xbox One exclusive at an earlier stage of development called Phantom Dust - which is billed as a \"battle for reality\". It had previously released an action-strategy title by the same name for the original Xbox a decade ago.\nThe in-house games publisher also previewed a dragon-fighting title - developed by Japan's Platinum Games - called Scalebound for the new console, and a fresh version of its open-world third-person shooter Crackdown, originally released for the Xbox 360.\nOne expert said offering such distinctive titles could prove critical to Microsoft's attempts to woo those who had not yet upgraded to a \"new-gen\" console.\n\"Since Xbox dropped the DRM [digital rights management] stuff before launch and then ditched the Kinect as a must-have about a month ago, the actual level of differentiation between PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has really shrunk,\" said Ed Barton, an analyst at the Ovum consultancy.\n\"So, one of the only differentiators left is exclusive game titles - there's not much left in to pick between them based on hardware.\"\nAnalysis from E3: Dave Lee, Los Angeles\nFirst stop at this year's E3 was the Galen Center, a venue usually used for basketball, where Microsoft rolled out its portfolio for the coming year and a bit.\nAt its heart, the crowd-pleasing announcement of the Halo Master Collection - a complete compendium of the Halo series, plus a \"beta\" of the latest entry in the series, Halo 5 Guardians. It won the biggest cheer in the arena, for mostly nostalgia purposes.\nBut a new console can't rely on old franchises, even if they are of Halo's calibre. That's where Sunset Overdrive comes in - an (almost) open-world game with a lead character that, at first glance, is more than slightly irritating.\nWhile the Xbox event was a typically loud, brash affair - it was intentionally no-nonsense. This was all about games, and the firm has set out a convincing staple for the year ahead, even if it is a little reliant on tried and tested brands.\nIt all points to a strong 2014 and 2015 for Xbox One. It needs to be if it is to claw back some of the ground lost to the PlayStation 4.\nTellingly, there was only a brief mention of the Kinect - a peripheral touted last year to be integral to the Xbox One experience.\nNot so this time - only two titles mentioned the Kinect directly: a dancing game and a baffling music-creation game based on the old Disney film, Fantasia.\nLater we get to see what Sony has to offer.\nSquare Enix picked the show to premiere a trailer for its next Lara Croft game, called Rise of the Tomb Raider. The character appears to be suffering post-traumatic stress disorder after her previous origins story, but little of the new plot was revealed.\nActivision was more forthcoming with a long sequence from its forthcoming Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare game, showing soldiers fighting swarms of drones in a battle-hit city.

Quitting the Paris deal, signed by nearly 200 countries, will take a few years but this is unequivocally a promise kept.\nBefore: One of Mr Trump's trademark rally pledges was to repeal and replace Obamacare - his predecessor's attempt to extend healthcare to the estimated 15% of the country who are not covered.\nIt is widely hated by Republicans, who say the law imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a \"job killer\" and decrying the reforms - officially the Affordable Care Act - as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.\nAfter: Within two days of his election he softened his approach, saying he wanted to keep the \"strongest assets\".\nThen the House Republicans put forward a plan, which the president fully backed, but it was mauled by doctors' groups, hospitals and other parts of the medical industry. The government's own budget office said it would strip insurance from millions of Americans, and its approval rating among the public sank. The Democrats opposed it and several wings of the Republican party were uneasy. It was passed by the House of Representatives but the Senate has said it will rewrite the bill from scratch.\nBefore: His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises.\nMr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it.\nAfter: Mexico maintains it will never pay for it, and even the president has conceded that the US will have to pay up front and then seek reimbursement in some way.\nThe US Congress is exploring funding options for the wall, but many Republicans will be unhappy about footing a bill which could rise to $21.5bn (\u00c2\u00a317.2bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report.\nThat's much higher than Mr Trump's estimated price tag of $12bn (\u00c2\u00a39.6bn).\nThere are also landowners who protest against a \"government land grab\" - and a lawsuit from an environmental group launched in April.\n\"We're building the wall,\" he said in February. \"In fact it's going to start very soon.\"\nBefore: Mr Trump called Nafta \"a disaster\" and warned that the TPP \"is going to be worse, so we will stop it.\"\nAfter: Mr Trump pledged to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He did in his first few days.\nAnd he vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Association (Nafta) and, after threatening to pull out, the White House has said that Canada and the US have agreed to talks.\nBefore: Mr Trump initially promised to ban all Muslims entering the US - a \"total and complete\" shutdown should remain until the US authorities \"can figure out what's going on\".\nBut he switched to \"extreme vetting\" after he became the party's presidential candidate.\nAfter: As president, he has introduced two travel bans, which have both become ensnarled by legal challenges. The second was a slightly watered-down version of the first, but a judge in Hawaii said barring people from six mainly Muslim countries, even temporarily, violated constitutional protections against religious discrimination. Another judge in Maryland cited Trump campaign statements as evidence.\nPresident Trump has railed against \"judicial overreach\" and hinted that he may take the case to the Supreme Court, but has said little on the matter in a round of media interviews this week.\nFive questions on the revised travel ban\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are 11.3 million - \"have to go\".\nAfter: As polling day approached, his stance began to soften slightly, then after the election he scaled it back to some two to three million deportations of people who \"are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers\".\nThe Migration Policy Institute, a US-based think tank, has one of the higher figures for illegal immigrants with criminal records, which it puts at 890,000, including people charged with crossing the border illegally.\nThe number of removals peaked in 2012 and has been falling since. It is too early to say if there has been an increase since President Trump's inauguration.\nReality Check: Is deporting of 'bad dudes' at record rate?\nTrump voter's husband faces deportation\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it \"obsolete\". One issue that bugged him was whether members were pulling their weight and \"paying their bills\". In one New York Times interview in July 2016, he even hinted that the US would not come to the aid of a member invaded by Russia.\nAfter: But as he hosted Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House in April, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. \"I said it [Nato] was obsolete,\" Mr Trump said. \"It's no longer obsolete.\"\nBefore: During a speech in Iowa in November 2015, Mr Trump warned that he would, using an expletive, bomb so-called Islamic State into obliteration.\nAfter: The president dropped the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on an IS-stronghold in Afghanistan.\nAt the site of the Mother of All Bombs\nBefore: Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a \"currency manipulator\" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of \"raping\" the US. China has been accused of suppressing the yuan to make its exports more competitive with US goods.\nAfter: He told the Wall Street Journal in April that China had not been \"currency manipulators\" for some time and had actually been trying to prevent the yuan from further weakening.\nBefore: \"I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents.\"\nAfter: He vowed to appoint a conservative justice and he has - Neil Gorsuch. It took a procedural change to Senate rules, but it's a victory nonetheless.\nBefore: Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding \"immediately\" and \"make it also much worse\", adding \"torture works\".\nAfter: But after his inauguration, the president said he would defer to the opposing belief, espoused by Defence Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo.\nMr Pompeo said during his confirmation hearing said he would \"absolutely not\" reinstate such methods.\nBefore: \"Lock her up\" was one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters.\nThey wanted to see Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in prison over the use of her private email server while secretary of state.\nAnd Mr Trump was more than willing to back their calls for, at the very least, a fresh investigation. During the debates, he told Mrs Clinton: \"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.\"\nAfter: The president-elect's tone changed almost as soon as he had won, describing the woman he had said was \"such a nasty woman\" as someone the country owed \"a debt of gratitude\". Later, he said he \"hadn't given [the prosecution] a lot of thought\" and had other priorities.\nOn 22 November, Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not pursue a further investigation - to help Mrs Clinton \"heal\".\nBefore: The country's infrastructure \"will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it\", he said in his victory speech in November.\nAfter: Has repeated his vow to spend big on the country's roads, rail and airports, but no sign yet of action.\nBefore: Mr Trump pledged during his campaign to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a divided city which both Israelis and Palestinians claim.\nAfter: He approved a waiver to keep the embassy in place, but suggested in a statement that it would be eventually relocated. \"The question is not if that move happens, but only when,\" the White House said, adding the decision was taken in order to \"maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between Israel and the Palestinians\".", "summary": "Donald Trump made a string of promises during his long campaign to be the 45th president of the United States.", "id": "37982000"}
{"document": "They advocated positivity and harmony - expressed through the medium of funk.\n\"From my youngest days, I always felt certain affinities with the idea of being a preacher,\" said bandleader Maurice White, who has died at the age of 74.\n\"Being joyful and positive was the whole objective of our group. Our goal was to reach all the people and to keep a universal atmosphere. All of our songs had that positive energy. To create uplifting music was the objective.\"\nBlending jazz, Latin and soul with an infectious rhythmic pulse, Earth Wind & Fire they sold more than 90 million albums around the world.\nSeveral of their records went multi-platinum, and songs like September, Fantasy and After The Love Has Gone remain gold-plated disco classics.\nOne of the 1970's most accomplished live acts, they regularly featured 16 players on stage, all of whom could turn on a dime. They even incorporated pyrotechnics, lighting effects and magic tricks (floating pianos, disappearing acts) into their set. A young Michael Jackson could often be found in the audience, taking notes.\n\"We were playing highly sophisticated music, and we had to figure out a way to keep people's eyes on the stage,\" White recalled. \"I figured if people were listening to something they hadn't heard before, we had to do exciting things.\"\nWhite's death robs the band not just of their founder member, but their driving force - a musician who steered the band through multiple line-up changes, and honed their sound for crossover appeal. Even when Parkinson's disease robbed him of the ability to play in the 1990s, White took care of the band's business affairs, and devotedly guarded their legacy.\nAnnouncing his death, White's brother and bandmate Verdine simply called him his \"hero and best friend\".\nBorn in Memphis on 19 December 1941, Maurice White was the son of a doctor and grandson of a New Orleans honky-tonk pianist.\nHe moved to Chicago with his family and sang gospel from a young age, but didn't learn to read music until he was 18, when he enrolled at the Chicago Conservatory of Music as a percussion scholar.\nUpon graduating, he earned his stripes as a session drummer at Chess Records, playing for Etta James, Muddy Waters and Fontella Bass, before leaving to join popular jazz group The Ramsey Lewis Trio, where he learned to play the Kalimba - an African thumb piano that later featured on several Earth Wind & Fire hits.\n\"Ramsey helped shape my musical vision beyond just the music,\" White later recalled. \"I learned about performance and staging.\"\nIn 1969, he struck out on his own, forming a songwriting partnership with keyboardist Don Whitehead and singer Wade Flemons, which evolved into a band called the Salty Peppers.\nThe group scored a local hit with the effervescent party track La La Time but when a follow-up flopped, he took his bandmates to Los Angeles, adding singer Sherry Scott to form the first version of Earth Wind & Fire, naming the group after the elements on his astrological chart.\nCritics found their first two albums intriguing but derivative - with many noting a heavy debt to Sly & The Family Stone.\n\"What they lack, though, is Sly's sense of derision and irony,\" said Rolling Stone in its review of their self-titled debut.\n\"The lyrics, unwisely printed inside, are as preachy and lovepeace cloying as anything Motown has done recently.\"\nTaking note, White abandoned the line-up, save his brother, and formed a new band based around younger musicians - notably singing percussionist Philip Bailey, recruited from a Denver R&B outfit called Friends & Love.\nIt marked the beginning of the group's imperial phase. 1973's Head to the Sky brought new audiences while the 1974 follow-up, Open Our Eyes, was their first genuine hit.\nA year later, they scored their only number one single with the slinky, irresistible Shining Star.\nThe song came to White when he took a night-time walk in rural Colorado, where the band were recording their landmark 1975 album, That's the Way of the World.\nOverwhelmed by the beautiful clarity of the night sky, he came up with the chorus - \"Shining star for you to see / What your life can truly be\" - and brought it to the rest of the band.\nThey spent days perfecting the track, with White and Bailey layering vocal upon vocal to create the stark a capella fade at the end of the song.\nSpeaking to MixOnline in 2004, the band said they had been determined to make a crossover hit.\n\"This was an important album - one that signaled whether we would go on and become a mainstream group or just be an R&B act,\" Verdine White said.\n\"At that particular time, they didn't really cross a lot of black acts over to mainstream radio.

We just stayed focused on the music.\"\nBy the end of the decade, the band was a regular presence on the pop charts, with melodic hits like After The Love Has Gone and Boogie Wonderland (a collaboration with The Emotions).

But he was still in the driver's seat to make decisions. It created a lot of tension.\"\nThe slimmed-down band scored yet another number one R&B single in 1987, System of Survival, and continue to tour and release albums to this day.\nWhite had been battling Parkinson's disease since 1992, and announced his diagnosis in 2000, the same year the band were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nBut he remained a passionate advocate for his band, and their cosmic message.\n\"It's important to put the emphasis on the positive aspect,\" he told The Chicago Tribune. \"I have learned that music helps a lot of people survive, and they want songs that can give them something - I guess you could call it hope.\"", "summary": "To understand Earth Wind & Fire, you just had to look at their song titles: Mighty Mighty, Happy Feelin', Boogie Wonderland.", "id": "35500894"}

{"document": "In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning the president framed any disclosure of intelligence information as a calculated move to advance US national security priorities.\nIn a press conference hours later, National Security Adviser HR McMaster said Mr Trump's revelations where \"wholly appropriate\".\nThis was always going to be the most effective response, as the president has broad powers to declassify whatever he deems necessary. As the old Richard Nixon line goes: \"When the president does it, that means it is not illegal\".\nThe president's explanation is not absolution, however. A wave of the hand on Twitter isn't going to make this story go away any time soon. Here are five reasons why.\nLet's get the impeachment question out of the way first. Shortly after the Washington Post story detailing the allegations broke, there were cries of \"treason\" from Mr Trump's more vociferous critics and calls for immediate removal from office.\nThe charge that Mr Trump, through ignorance or boastfulness, casually disclosed highly classified intelligence for no reason may not be a criminal offence, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't create a political controversy that could, in a worst-case scenario for the president, end in his impeachment.\nThe process for impeachment for \"high crimes and misdemeanours\" as outlined in the US constitution is a political act. A simple majority of the House of Representatives can impeach, initiating a trial in the Senate and a two-thirds vote necessarily for removal.\nAs the writers of Lawfare Blog point out, Mr Trump's opponents could accuse him of violations of his oath of office to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the US Constitution - a catch-all category cited in the three previous times a president has been seriously threatened with impeachment.\nJust because it's possible, however, doesn't mean it's likely. And again, it has nothing to do with the law and everything to do with politics - and how the story plays out from here.\nLike Indiana Jones looking at a chamber full of snakes, many in the Trump White House must be muttering to themselves: \"Russians. Why did it have to be the Russians?\"\nAllegations of cosier-than-desired relations with the US geopolitical adversary have bedevilled Mr Trump since the early days of his presidential campaign.\nHe's been questioned about the praise he's lavished on President Vladimir Putin, some of his aides are caught up in the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the US 2016 election, his attorney general was forced to recuse himself because of an undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and his first national security adviser was fired for obfuscating about his Russia ties (and is one of the people under FBI investigation to boot).\nAll of this was hanging in the air as Mr Trump met with Mr Kislyak and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov last week, just hours after he fired James Comey, the FBI director in overseeing the Russia investigation. US press was barred from attending, and the only photos that were released came from the Russian state-run news service.\nIt was never going to be a good look. Now, in light of the Washington Post's revelations, it's a terrible one.\nMr Trump's tweets explained that he was \"sharing\" information with the Russian officials in order to foster co-operation on important global issues like the fight against the so-called Islamic State. As Mr Trump points out, he has the \"absolute right\" to do so.\nThe fact that it's the Russians involved, however, means the story will pack that much more powerful a punch.\nBack in February the Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence officials were withholding sensitive intelligence information from Mr Trump out of concern that the material could be \"leaked or compromised\".\nDuring the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton regularly said Mr Trump could not be trusted to competently manage the intricacies of US foreign policy.\nNow, according to the Washington Post report, Mr Trump may have disclosed information provided to the US by a key ally that has \"access to the inner workings of the Islamic State\".\nThe Post said that its sources \"declined to identify the ally but said it has previously voiced frustration with Washington's inability to safeguard sensitive information related to Iraq and Syria\". One US official said it was potentially a \"blow\" to the US relationship with that ally.\nIf key US allies become reluctant to share intelligence data with the US, that would be a significant blow to the nation's national security - even if the details of this particular story are never fully established.\nThrow in last week's Trump tweet implying that he - or someone - may have \"tapes\" of conversations made in the White House, and the result may be a chilling effect on US foreign relations across the board.\nThis latest controversy should also be viewed in the context of what has become a simmering feud between the president and members of the intelligence community.\nShortly after he tweeted out that two-part explanation of his White House meeting with the Russians, Mr Trump sent another message on a familiar theme - leaks.\n\"I have been asking Director Comey and others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community...\"\nBack in January then-President-elect Trump sent a tweet comparing leaky intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.\nThe president is clearly angered by what he views as a litany of embarrassing disclosures -about phone calls with leaders of Australia and Mexico, conversations his national security adviser had with the Russian ambassador and salacious details from a Trump-Russia dossier circulated among intelligence officials.\nThe president has threatened massive re-organisation of the US intelligence bureaucracy and an aggressive investigation into the source of the leaks - and it appears members of that community are striking back.\nMonday evening, upon hearing of details about the Washington Post story, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine echoed a familiar lament.\n\"Can we have a crisis-free day?\" she said. \"That's all I'm asking.\"\nOn Tuesday morning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a similar take.\n\"We could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things,\" he told Bloomberg Television, \"so we can focus on our agenda, which is deregulation, tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare.\"\nA few of the Republican usual suspects who have been more outspoken in their criticism are continuing on that tack.\nCongressman Justin Amash of Michigan tweeted that the White House should share \"details of the president's meeting\" with Congress.\nOnce again Senator John McCain of Arizona found something the president did \"deeply disturbing\".\nBarring further revelations, however, the president has constructed a defence around which Republicans can rally. While members of Mr Trump's party may grouse about the ongoing administration fiascos, previous complaints have been followed by inaction. Until there is evidence to the contrary, this time looks to be no different.\nLast week reporters raged over the fact that White House officials, from Vice-President Mike Pence on down, put forward an explanation regarding why the president had fired FBI Director James Comey that was completely undercut within moments of Mr Trump opening his mouth in a sit-down interview on Thursday with NBC News.\nThe president would later tweet that because he is a \"very active president\" his press team can't be relied upon to convey his positions with \"prefect accuracy\".\n\"Why were so many people giving answers that just weren't correct?\" Jonathan Karl asked Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \"Were you guys in the dark?\"\nNeedless to say reporters this week took the early White House spin that Mr Trump only discussed \"common threats\" with the Russians, per Deputy National Security Advisor Dina Powell, with more than a grain of salt. It appears their scepticism was at least partially validated when, on Tuesday morning, Mr Trump said he had shared \"facts pertaining to terrorism\" with Russia.\nPresidents and the media typically have an adversarial relationship, but this White House is rapidly burning through any residual goodwill it may have had.\nGiven that Mr Trump and his team often refer to the press as the \"opposition party\", however, the may not lose much sleep over this development.\nTwitter: @awzurcher", "summary": "The Trump White House has now settled on its defence of the president's meeting with the Russian delegation, in which he reportedly revealed classified information to his guests.", "id": "39941124"}
{"document": "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph).\nAnd now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days.\nIf you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\"\nIndeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff.\nUntil recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real.\nTo a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right.\nAtletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles.\nThe discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes.\nHard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football.\nFor any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air.\nIn the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer.\nThat is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks.\nThat starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths.\nUnder Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack.\nAs the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space.\nSimeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable.\nMore than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head.\nFor years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up.\nThat reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster.\nUnder Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort.\nWhen referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour.\nAs the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen.\nBut he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility.\nFormer Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\"\nRobinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.", "summary": "In Britain, Argentine Diego Simeone is best remembered as the man whose reaction to a petulant kick by David Beckham resulted in the England star famously being sent off during a World Cup game in 1998.", "id": "26966304"}

The department yet again failed to learn from previous disasters, like the Metronet contract. It failed to heed advice from its lawyers. It failed to respond appropriately to early warning signs that things were going wrong.\n\"Senior management did not have proper oversight of the project. Cuts in staffing and in consultancy budgets contributed to a lack of key skills.\n\"The project suffered from a lack of leadership.

Virgin will continue running the service until November 2014, when a new long-term franchise will begin.\nIn December, the National Audit Office calculated that there would be a \"significant cost to the taxpayer\" as a result of the fiasco.\nIt said costs for staff, advisers, lawyers and the two reviews into the fiasco added up to \u00a38.9m, on top of the estimated \u00a340m it will take to reimburse firms for the cost of their bids.\nBob Crow, the leader of the RMT union, which represents rail workers, called for wholesale renationalisation of the railways.\n\"The stench from the fall-out of the West Coast franchise continues to hang over Britain's transport industry as it becomes clearer with every examination that the ministers responsible for this shambles could not be trusted to run a whelk stall let alone multi-billion government contracts,\" he said.\n\"Privatisation is a corrosive and expensive political project doomed to repeated and costly failure, twice on the East Coast and now on the West,\" he added.\n\"Fiddling with processes won't work. It's the whole, rotten policy that needs dumping with a return to public ownership.\"\nBut a Department for Transport spokesman said: \"The independent Laidlaw inquiry published in December identified the unique and exceptional circumstances which led to failures in the West Coast franchising programme and crucially what steps the department should take to prevent this from happening again.\n\"The department has accepted all the recommendations and has taken immediate steps by bringing together all rail activity under a single director general and recruiting a senior director to lead the franchising programme, as well as improving internal governance and strengthening oversight and accountability.\n\"Not only will these reinforce the franchising process but will also protect rail infrastructure projects such as HS2 and the biggest programme of rail electrification.\"\nMaria Eagle, the shadow transport secretary, called on Prime Minister David Cameron to \"take responsibility for the rail franchising fiasco, instead of allowing ministers to hide behind their civil servants\".\n\"The government must accept the finding of the Public Accounts Committee that it was the short-sighted decision by ministers to axe external audits of multi-billion pound contracts that ended up with at least \u00a350m of taxpayers' money going down the drain,\" she added.\n\"It is a disgrace that every politician responsible for the bungled franchise deal has either remained in the cabinet or been promoted to it.\"\nRichard Hebditch of Campaign for Better Transport, which fights for better public transport, said the report showed the biggest problem was the franchising system itself.\n\"Franchising needs to be completely reformed so that what counts are improvements to the service on offer, rather than complex calculations of profit and loss that don't stack up,\" he said.", "summary": "A \"complete lack of common sense\" in the Department for Transport's handling of the West Coast Main Line franchise deal will cost taxpayers \"\u00a350m at the very least\", MPs have said.", "id": "21577826"}

That's why I believe we need a full explanation from the local authority as to why this decision was allowed to be taken.\n\"If we say you cannot foster children because you're a member of a mainstream political party or because you have views on multiculturalism then that's utterly wrong.\n\"This decision is arbitrary, ideological and indefensible.\"\nThe education secretary added that the government was bringing forward new laws in the Children and Families' Bill to reverse the current position, which takes into account ethnic and cultural factors when placing children for adoption.\n\"We want to make it clear that you should not allow ideological matters to preclude what's in the best interest of the child.\"\nRotherham councillor Paul Lakin, cabinet member for children, young people and families Services has ordered an immediate investigation.\nHe said: \"Membership of a political party should not stop someone fostering children.

It welcomed the council's decision to investigate what had happened.\nThe council's strategic director of children and young people's services, Joyce Thacker, earlier defended the decision, saying it was influenced by UKIP's immigration policy.\nShe said: \"I have legal advice I have to follow for the placement of children and I was criticised before for not making sure their cultural and ethnic needs were met.\n\"If the party mantra is, for example, ending the active promotion of multiculturalism I have to think about that... I have to think of their longer-term needs.\nMs Thacker added she did not think UKIP was a racist party, but said it had \"very clear\" immigration policies which she could not ignore.\nSOURCE: UKIP website\nThe unnamed couple in their late 50s, who have been approved foster parents for seven years, were eight weeks into the placement when they were approached by social workers about their membership of the party.\nThe BBC's Robin Brant reports that UKIP sources say the couple have been members of the party for \"over three years\" and that Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council was \"tipped off\" about their membership.\nAnd the couple first knew there were problems around their continued fostering on 14 November.\nThe wife told the BBC she believed the decision had been taken \"prior to the social worker visiting us in person to tell us that the children were being removed because we were UKIP members\".\nShe insisted they felt they were meeting the cultural needs of the three children.\n\"We were actively encouraging these children to speak their own language... we enjoyed singing one of their folk songs in their native language.\n\"Having been told of the religious denomination of these children - we took steps to ensure that a school of their denomination was found.\n\"The children have now been placed with families who are white British, therefore how are these people going to meet the cultural needs of the children?\" she added.\nUKIP's immigration policy states the party wants an \"end [to] the active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism by local and national government\", and urges Britain to leave the European Union (EU).\nThe party's leader, Nigel Farage, said he was \"very upset and very angry\" about the decision and called for \"heads to roll\" at the council.\nHe added: \"This couple... have been fostering for many years and are very decent people. This was an awful shock to them, not to mention the upset for the children themselves.\"\nHe also accused the Labour-controlled council of bigotry towards his party.\nEarlier, Labour leader Ed Miliband called for the council to urgently investigate the circumstances of the case.\nHe insisted: \"Being a member of UKIP should not be a bar to adopting or fostering children.\n\"We need to find out the facts and the council urgently needs to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.\n\"There are thousands of children who need to be looked after, who need fostering, we shouldn't have the situation where membership of a party like UKIP excludes you from doing that.\"\nRobert Tapsfield, chief executive of the Fostering Network, said the decision seemed \"very strange\" considering the council viewed the couple as providing a good standard of care.\nHe said the placement of foster children should not be influenced by their political affiliations.", "summary": "Michael Gove has branded a decision by Rotherham council to remove three children from a foster couple because they belong to UKIP as \"indefensible\".", "id": "20476654"}

{"document": "New pictures of the surface reveal a lumpy texture in places that researchers speculate could have been the body's original building blocks.\nTheir appearance means they are being dubbed \"goosebumps\", which is a bit of fun given the comet's duck-like shape.\nBut if this interpretation is correct, it represents a major discovery.\n\"We still have to model this, but I think they really could be pointing back in time to the early days of the Solar System - to the formation of the building blocks of cometary nuclei,\" said imaging team leader Holger Sierks from the Max-Planck-Institute for Solar System Research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany.\n\"Our thinking is that accreting gas and dust would have formed little 'pebbles' at first that grew and grew until they got up to the size of these goosebumps - about 3m in size - and for whatever reason, they couldn't then grow any further.\n\"Eventually, they'd have found a region of instability and clumped together to form the nucleus,\" he told BBC News.\nRosetta team-member Stephen Lowry said the goosebumps (which to some also look like a clutch of \"dinosaur eggs\") were among the most startling results to have come out of the mission so far.\n\"Remember, these objects would have formed at least 4.5 billion years ago. Where else could you see physical evidence of processes that were happening that long ago? So, it's very exciting, but we have to be sure that this regular lattice structure represents genuine cometesimals and is not some feature that has somehow been produced as a result of ices simply sublimating from the comet; because we don't see the goosebumps everywhere,\" the Kent University, UK, expert cautioned.\nThe presence of this lumpy texture on 67P is just one observation made in a slew of papers published as a special edition in this week's Science Magazine.\nThe papers are really a first take at trying to characterise the 4km-wide \"space duck\", which Rosetta will be following throughout 2015 as it sweeps around the Sun.\nCameras on the probe have now imaged 70% of the comet's surface. The unseen fraction, which lies in the southern hemisphere, will be mapped as it emerges from the darkness of winter.\nThe team has defined 19 regions on 67P, giving each the name of an Ancient Egyptian deity.\nThese zones - and more are likely to be added in future - display five basic terrain types, from areas of high dust accumulation to exposed craggy faces composed of rock-like material.\nThe researchers report some fascinating behaviours over and above the expected sight of jets of gas and dust hurtling away from the comet as its ices warm and vaporise.\nFor example, these jets produce strong \"winds\" that appear to drive dust particles into dunes.\n\"It sounds highly improbable,\" commented Nic Thomas from Switzerland's University of Bern. \"We see sand dunes on the Earth, on Mars and on Venus, but all of those objects have gravity and thick atmospheres.\n\"On the comet, you have almost no gravity and it's not an atmosphere we could breathe. So, it really is difficult to conceive how you can make sand dunes on a cometary nucleus. The trick we think is that there are very strong winds there - 300m/s - and that these winds can, even though the density of the gas is very low, push particles around to make the dunes.\"\nAnother striking occurrence is a kind \"fluidisation\" effect that acts to smooth some surfaces.\nScientists think this occurs when ices change their structure. This results in a release of gas that can pick up local dust and make it move - albeit briefly - like a fluid. Something similar is seen on Earth when large volumes of hot ash tumble down the sides of volcanoes.\nAt the bottom of 67P, the so-called Imhotep region appears to have experienced repeated fluidisation events, recorded in defined layers.\nThe Rosetta pictures also pick up episodes of past explosive behaviour.  In one shot, a block of material the size of a football field has been lifted up and dropped beside the gaping hole it left behind in the comet's surface.\nIndeed, the violent release of gas at depth seems to be a common activity on 67P, followed by the collapse of material back into the void.\nThe data being gathered by the European Space Agency probe is going to keep scientists busy for years, but it is clear already that many of the old ideas about how comets are put together and how they behave will have to change.\nIt is obvious now that this comet is not a large lump of ice with some dust mixed in. Rather, it has a much more complex construction, incorporating significantly more dust and many rocky components. This is very evident from the ratio of dust to gas being ejected by the comet (four to one), and all those craggy cliff features where stiff, consolidated materials seem to dominate.\n\"We used to think of comets as 'dirty snowballs'; we now think 'icy dirt-ball' is a much better description,\" said Simon Green from the UK's Open University. \"That's the way 67P looks - a solid object with ice vaporising from somewhere below the surface.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "Scientists working on Europe's Rosetta probe, which is tracking Comet 67P, say they may have found evidence for how such icy objects were formed.", "id": "30931445"}
{"document": "Zhou Youguang helped invent Pinyin, a writing system that turns Chinese characters into words using letters from the Roman alphabet.\nThis makes it easier to learn how to pronounce Chinese words, and is credited with helping raise literacy rates in China.\nDespite his achievements, Mr Zhou remains largely unknown in his home country.\nPerhaps that is because the 106-year-old is a defiant character, refusing to take much credit for his work or pander to the Chinese Communist Party.\nHe is critical of the party that governs China - and old enough not to care who is listening to what he has to say.\n\"What are they going to do, come and take me away?\" he said in an interview with the BBC in his sparsely furnished Beijing home.\nPositive outlook\nMr Zhou's life has coincided with most of the momentous events of China's recent history, as it has moved from imperial dynasty to peoples' republic to capitalist powerhouse.\nHe was born in 1906 into a wealthy family that managed to lose its money three times: first in the Qing dynasty, then during World War II and finally during the Cultural Revolution, a political campaign launched by Mao Zedong.\nNevertheless, he managed to get a good education, studying economics at St John's University, one of the best educational institutions in Shanghai in the 1920s when he was there.\nSeveral years of his early life were spent working in the US for a Chinese bank. \"It was at No 1 Wall Street - the centre of imperialism,\" he said, laughing.\nMr Zhou laughs a lot, a result of an optimistic outlook. \"There are good aspects to even bad things,\" he said.\nThat does not mean everything in the centenarian's life has gone his way.\nHis daughter died of appendicitis just before her sixth birthday and, like many intellectuals, he was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.\nA common form of punishment at the time - in the late 1960s - was to send educated city professionals to the countryside to \"learn from the masses\".\nMr Zhou spent several years working in the fields of Ningxia, a poor region in western China.\n\"It was a waste of time and stopped me doing other things,\" he said, unable to stop himself laughing again.\nDespite hardships, Mr Zhou did have one enormous stroke of luck.\nWhen the Communist Party took over in China in 1949, he was in the US. He decided to return, along with many others, to build a new country.\nHe initially become an economics professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, but in 1955 was invited to join a committee in Beijing looking at simplifying the Chinese language.\nAt first he resisted, saying he had no professional experience in this field. He was finally persuaded to join the project by a friend.\nIt was a decision that probably saved his life.\nA few years later, Chairman Mao launched one of his first purges, and many of those caught in the mayhem were those who had gone back to China from abroad.\n\"All university professors who'd returned from the US were labelled 'Rightists'. Many committed suicide, including some good friends. I luckily missed it,\" he said.\nIt was one of the few moments that Mr Zhou did not laugh.\nDark future?\nThe work he did on the committee not only saved him, it allowed him to make a major contribution to the Chinese language.\nWhen he started work on developing Pinyin, 85% of Chinese people could not read or write. Now, that is just a few percent.\nThere had been previous attempts to Romanise Chinese characters, but the system developed by Mr Zhou and his colleagues is the one that most people now use, and is recognised internationally.\n\"We spent three years developing pinyin. People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters,\" he said.\nHaving lived so long and done such high-profile work, the linguist has met more than his fair share of historical characters.\nOne of his favourite stories is about Puyi, China's last emperor, who became an ordinary citizen under Chairman Mao.\nMr Zhou once belonged to a Chinese body that advises the government, work that allowed him to dine at the organisation's canteen in Beijing.\nDuring one of the country's periodic food shortages, he ate there daily, taking his wife along too. This meant more food at home for Mr Zhou's relatives.\n\"Everyday when I went to eat, there was an old man sitting next to me. He was also there with his wife,\" he said.\n\"It was Puyi - the last emperor. Imagine, even the emperor had to eat there because he didn't have enough food.\"\nMr Zhou's age has also given him a long view of history. He believes the Chinese Communist Party will not always rule the country.\n\"China will have to release itself from communism. The future will be dark if it doesn't,\" said Mr Zhou, who retired at 85, but is still writing books.\nIt is a damning comment from a man who came back to China because he believed the Communist Party when its leaders said they were democratic.\nDoes he ever regret that decision?\n\"We believed Mao's words. We didn't know that when he got into power he would become the worst kind of dictator,\" said Mr Zhou.\n\"But I don't regret coming back - there's no point,\" he added, laughing again.", "summary": "Students struggling to learn Chinese might not know it, but their task has been made easier because of the work of one man.", "id": "17455067"}

it also includes many women.\nWhat people think: They are mainly seen as a scourge for urban women - usually from wealthier social groups - who try to push the boundaries of the dress code.\nThis includes wearing the headscarf as far back on the head as possible, or by wearing looser clothing, especially in the heat of summer, although men sporting \"Western\" hairstyles are also at risk.\nFear of encountering them has even prompted the creation of Android app that helps people avoid Gasht-e Ershad mobile checkpoints.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani has expressed opposition to the Gasht-e Ershad, but Iran's constitution gives him little sway over the security forces.\nName: Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, or Mutawa (Arabic for Particularly obedient to God)\nWho they are: Formed in 1940, the Mutawa is tasked with enforcing Islamic religious law - Sharia - in public places.\nThis includes rules forbidding unrelated males and females to socialise in public, as well as a dress code that encourages women to wear a veil covering all but their eyes.\nInstead of a police-style uniform, they wear a traditional Saudi robe and keffiyeh.\nWhat people think: Although the Mutawa is widely disliked among liberals and the youth, general opinion in the conservative Sunni-majority kingdom supports it.\nBut even conservatives have been irritated by recent high-profile cases deemed excessive or internationally embarrassing, such as an actor being charged for letting fans take selfies with him, or a female mannequin being seized because of its clothing.\nPerhaps in response to this criticism, the authorities have curbed the force's powers, as a result of which it can no longer arrest or pursue people but can only report them to the regular police.\nName: Public Order Police\nWho they are: The Public Order Police was set up in 1993 to enforce Sharia enshrined in law for Muslims in the then-northern Sudan by President Omar al-Bashir.\nThey have the power to arrest, and suspects are tried - often at speed - in special Public Order Courts; punishments can include flogging or prison.\nWhat people think: Many Sudanese resent their activity as an oppressive and often arbitrary interference in private lives, although some - mostly Salafists and other religious conservatives - support their activities.\nThe force is known for shutting down private mixed-sex events, upbraiding women for immodest dress and raiding businesses seen as being in breach of Sharia.\nIt drew international condemnation when female journalist Lubna al-Hussein was arrested and jailed after being caught wearing loose-fitting slacks in public in 2008.\nName: Various, usually collectively known as \"religious officers\"\nWho they are: These are bodies run by Malaysia's federal states - or the federal government for federal territories - to enforce Sharia, which applies to the two thirds of the population who are Muslim.\nThey have the power of arrest, and possible offences range from day-time eating during Ramadan to women and men being \"in close proximity\".\nCases are tried by Sharia courts separate from the ordinary court system.\nWhat people think: Religious officers have often been accused of overstepping their remit - a situation often muddied by ambiguity about which takes precedence in certain cases - normal legislation or Sharia.\nIn April, religious officers arrested several people during a raid on a transgender group's fundraising event, accusing participants of hosting a beauty pageant, which Muslims were banned from attending by a 1996 fatwa, or Islamic religious decree.\nThe group denies the accusation.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Many cancers, such as pancreatic, are detected only after they have become untreatable and fatal.\nThere are marked differences between cancerous and healthy tissues.\nGoogle's ambition is to constantly monitor the blood for the unique traces of cancer, allowing diagnosis long before any physical symptoms appear.\nThe project is being conducted by the search company's research unit, Google X, which is dedicated to investigating potentially revolutionary innovations.\nIt marks the firm's latest shift into the medical sector following its work on glucose-measuring contact lenses for patients with diabetes and the acquisition of a start-up that developed a spoon to counteract the tremors caused by Parkinson's disease.\nGoogle has also bought stakes in Calico, an anti-ageing research company, and 23andMe, which offers personal genetic-testing kits.\nThe diagnostic project is being led by Dr Andrew Conrad, a molecular biologist who previously developed a cheap HIV test that has become widely used.\n\"What we are trying to do is change medicine from reactive and transactional to proactive and preventative,\" he told the BBC.\n\"Nanoparticles... give you the ability to explore the body at a molecular and cellular level.\"\nGoogle is designing a suite of nanoparticles which are intended to match markers for different conditions.\nThey could be tailored to stick to a cancerous cell or a fragment of cancerous DNA.\nOr they could find evidence of fatty plaques about to break free from the lining of blood vessels.

Google believes it will be possible to construct porous nanoparticles that alter colour as potassium passes through.\n\"Then [you can] recall those nanoparticles to a single location - because they are magnetic - and that location is the superficial vasculature of the wrist, [where] you can ask them what they saw,\" said Dr Conrad.\nUnattached nanoparticles would move differently in a magnetic field from those clumped around a cancer cell.\nIn theory, software could then provide a diagnosis by studying their movements.\nAs part of the project, the researchers have also explored ways of using magnetism to concentrate the nanoparticles temporarily in a single area.\nThe tech company's ambition is ultimately to create a wristband that would take readings of the nanoparticles via light and radio waves one or more times a day.\nProf Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, told the BBC News website: \"In principle this is great. Any newcomers with new ideas are welcome in the field.\n\"There is an urgent need for this.

Who needs treating even if a condition is discovered?\nThere is continuing controversy around breast cancer screening: for every life saved, three women have invasive treatment for a cancer that would never have proved fatal.\nScreening the body for disease is littered with dangers, and if it is not done carefully, it could make hypochondriacs out of all of us.\nThe nanoparticle project is the latest so-called \"moonshot\" to originate from Google X.\nOther schemes include the firm's driverless car effort and Project Loon, an attempt to provide internet access to remote areas via a network of high-altitude weather balloons.\nWhile such ideas have the potential to make money, there is also a high risk of failure, and Google X acknowledges that several of its ideas have been ditched before being made public.\nOne analyst commented that its parent was in a rare position to make such investments.\n\"Under normal circumstances this is the kind of thing that would worry investors because such projects are too long-term and the miss rate is too high,\" said Cyrus Mewawalla, from CM Research.\n\"But because Google's core search business is currently so strong, shareholders are not worried at the moment and are allowing the firm to take a gamble.\"\nAnalysis: Leo Kelion, technology desk editor\nGoogle's diagnostic project may never come to fruition, but its significance lies in the fact it represents part of a wider push by the firm into health tech.\nBearing in mind this is already a crowded sector, it begs the question: why?\nThe search firm denies that it wants to run its own diagnosis service, with all the privacy headaches that would entail, but the patents it creates along the way could prove lucrative.\nNo doubt the fact that co-founder and Google X chief Sergey Brin has been told that a gene mutation has increased his likelihood of contracting Parkinson's has also focused efforts.\nAnd the company clearly believes its expertise in \"big data\" analysis and its freedom to focus on giant leaps forward, rather than incremental steps, plays to its advantages.\nIt's worth remembering that another much hyped health idea, Google Flu Trends - which aimed to predict the spread of the virus based on internet searches - has been dubbed a failure by some after researchers said it had overestimated the number of cases in 100 out of 108 weeks.\nAnd US health watchdogs banned Google-backed 23andme from selling the the heath data part of its genetic screening kits last year.\nOn the other hand, Google's \"smart lens\" for diabetics shows promise, with Swiss firm Novartis stepping up to license the technology in July.\nAnd the forthcoming Android Fit platform, designed to harness data from other apps and wearables, has a good chance of success given the huge number of people using the operating system.", "summary": "Google is aiming to diagnose cancers, impending heart attacks or strokes and other diseases, at a much earlier stage than is currently possible.", "id": "29802581"}

If you convert those into slightly higher scores, when then there is no reason why you should get out, then I will be at 1,200 runs.\n\"I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it.\"\nAhead of the current match against Nottinghamshire at Hove, Wells had scored 221 runs in his five Championship appearances this season - with his high score of 79 not out coming against Somerset in April.\nHe admits he is \"a fair way\" off his target but is keen to contribute to Sussex's title challenge, with the Hove side currently fifth in the Division One table.\nI am targeting about 1,100 or 1,200 runs. I feel I am a better player now and I have the mental concentration and the defensive technique to do it\n\"I feel in really good nick at the moment and that there's a big three-figure score just around the corner,\" he said.\n\"I know if I keep doing the same things and backing myself I'll score a good amount of runs.\n\"It may sound cliched but if I get a thousand runs and we win the title then brilliant. If I get 900 and we win the title I'll take that. As long as the runs I'm scoring are contributing to winning efforts that is most important.\n\"We have got a strong squad and one hallmark of this season so far is competition for batting spaces. Everyone is under pressure as you know you need to get your runs.\n\"That is the way it should be in any squad. You shouldn't be able to rest on your laurels as people around you want to take your spot.\"\nThe former England Under-19 international, who is the son of former Sussex captain and one-time England Test player Alan, believes his time in Australia has improved his all-round game.\n\"I had a clear basic goal which was to work on a couple of technical areas to do with my trigger and my stance to be in a better position so that I can move more freely and make me more dynamic at the crease,\" he said.\n\"I feel I am a lot quicker on my feet, which will help in all formats of my game. I've worked on shots through the off-side, my one-day skills in general and my fitness.\"\nWells, meanwhile, describes his efforts to break into Sussex's one-day side as \"difficult and frustrating\".\nThe Eastbourne-born player has only made one competitive Twenty20 appearance for the club, coming against Glamorgan in 2011, and has made just a handful of appearances in List A competition.\nSussex have performed strongly in both Twenty20 and 40-over competition in recent years, but made group-stage exits in both formats in 2013.\nWells says the county calendar has not helped his cause but hopes the new schedule, which sees the T20 Blast played throughout the season and the new 50-over One Day Cup played in July and August, could benefit him.\n\"So far in my career I've started well in four-day competition then T20 comes along, I have a big break in the middle of my season and I try to find a way to keep the momentum going,\" he said.\n\"It has been quite hard work. I think this year with the Friday nights will help.\n\"I've been pushing as hard as I can and have been working a lot on my one-day skills. I can strike a ball as far as anyone in the squad.\n\"It is just about putting it all together into performances in the middle.\n\"It is hard with the schedule in and around four-day cricket to find time to play second XI T20 games.\n\"You need your currency, as it were, to show the coaches that you can do it.\"\nWells did play five CB40 matches for Sussex last season but only managed to make seven runs in four innings.\n\"Unfortunately last year I did get a run at the top of the order but I got out,\" he said.\n\"They were classic dismissals - a caught behind and a couple of lbws - but that's the way it goes. That is suddenly four games and you haven't scored a run.\n\"I feel I am in a good place with my game and am offering other skills, not just with my batting. I am determined to get in the side.\n\"Every year we always push quite hard in one-day competitions and have had quite a lot of success. Last year we didn't have that and I was disappointed to not get a go in a T20 game come the end of the campaign.\n\"Having said that the team needed its momentum and wanted to go with the same guys, which is absolutely understandable.\n\"All I can do is put myself in the best possible position that when I do get a chance, to take it.\"", "summary": "Luke Wells has established himself in Sussex's County Championship side but is hungry for more.", "id": "27475745"}

{"document": "To be 80-5 and give away a 200-run lead is a problem in any Test, let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on later in the match.\nHowever, for as tricky as the surface became - and some deliveries did do a lot - there were too many dismissals in England's second innings in particular that were not down to the pitch.\nThe tourists were shown the way initially by Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow in the first innings, then by opening pair Alastair Cook and Haseeb Hameed in the second.\nYet, English collapses - Michael Vaughan has referred to a \"little disease\" when panic appears to set in - were common. Four wickets for 29 runs and then four wickets for 30 runs in the first innings, eight wickets for 68 runs on the final day.\nIt ultimately comes down to a batsman's state of mind. When you get a difficult delivery or the ball misbehaves, it can be very hard to put that out of your thoughts, but that is what the very best are able to do.\nThe ability to clear your mind and focus on the next delivery is a skill my Test Match Special colleague Geoffrey Boycott speaks of so often.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSo it seems that the next three Tests in this series will be about England's mindset. Can they play every ball on its merits? Can they keep their chins up if they lose the toss? Can they be positive without being reckless? Can they remember that they have played some good cricket? Do they believe that they can beat India?\nThe answers to those questions are not straightforward because India is such a difficult place to tour. We knew from the start that playing five matches here straight after two in Bangladesh was going to be difficult in terms of managing morale and keeping spirits high.\nEngland do not have to look too far into the past for inspiration. They came from behind to win here four years ago.\nGoing further into the past, the 1984-85 tour led by David Gower that I was part of was a real success because the togetherness of the team helped us overcame everything that was thrown at us.\nIndira Gandhi, the prime minister, was assassinated hours after the touring party arrived. The UK's deputy high commissioner Percy Norris later suffered the same fate, a day after hosting a reception for the England team.\nEngland stayed out there despite fears the tour would be cancelled, then lost the first Test because of some questionable umpiring.\nYet, England came back to win that series 2-1 and that is the mindset that the class of 2016 have to adopt.\nIf they can, India can be beaten because we have already seen that these are two evenly matched sides. The hosts' only advantage is they have greater experience playing in these conditions.\nOff-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, the world's leading Test wicket-taker this year, does not look too frightening when conditions are not in his favour. The same can be said for his partner in crime Ravindra Jadeja. These are bowlers that can be handled.\nIndia also have plenty of batsmen yet to register runs. Openers KL Rahul and Murali Vijay both need a score, as do Ajinkya Rahane and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha.\nYes, Cheteshwar Pujara is in good form and captain Virat Kohli was in stellar touch in Visakhapatnam - he scored 248 runs and the winning margin was 246, so imagine the boon it would be for England if they can remove him cheaply.\nNot that the tourists do not have personnel issues of their own. Ben Duckett, who has made only 18 runs in three innings, looks very unlikely to play in the third Test in Mohali.\nEngland got into a muddle by not opening the batting with Hameed in Bangladesh and now both Gary Ballance and Duckett have failed at number four.\nThe next available option appears to be Jos Buttler, one of the most exciting limited-overs players in the world. Is he the answer in the top order of a Test line-up against the spinning ball? We just do not know.\nAdd to that the fact Buttler has played only one first-class match in the past year and there will be a lot of pressure on him if he is chosen to play in the next Test. Anyone saying with certainty that Buttler is the cavalry to solve England's problems is making a very big statement.\nSpinner Zafar Ansari is another who looks set to miss out on playing in the third Test. He may well have been left out anyway in order for England to play a fourth pace bowler, but he had a poor time with both ball and bat in Visakhapatnam.\nThose two aside, the other players that England have used in this series will all feel good.\nCook, Hameed, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Stokes and Bairstow have all made runs. Adil Rashid is really looking the part as a Test spin bowler, James Anderson has made an excellent return from injury and Chris Woakes will be raring to go after being rested for the second Test.\nThe only question England will have is over the fitness of Stuart Broad, who returned his best bowling figures in India with a strained tendon in his foot.\nIndia can be beaten and England certainly have the ability. Do they have the mentality?\nJonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.", "summary": "England will know it was a first-innings batting calamity that set the wheels in motion for India's 246-run win in the second Test in Visakhapatnam.", "id": "38048885"}
{"document": "Scientists have struggled to explain the so-called pause that began in 1999, despite ever increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.\nThe latest theory says that a naturally occurring 30-year cycle in the Atlantic Ocean is behind the slowdown.\nThe researchers says this slow-moving current could continue to divert heat into the deep seas for another decade.\nHowever, they caution that global temperatures are likely to increase rapidly when the cycle flips to a warmer phase.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global average temperatures have increased by around 0.05C per decade in the period between 1998 and 2012.\nThis compares with a decadal average of 0.12 between 1951 and 2012.\nMore than a dozen theories have been put forward on the cause of this pause in temperature growth that occurred while emissions of carbon dioxide were at record highs.\nThese ideas include the impact of pollution such as soot particles that have reflected back some of the Sun's heat into space.\nIncreased volcanic activity since 2000 has also been blamed, as have variations in solar activity.\nThe most recent perspectives have looked to the oceans as the locations of the missing heat.\nLast year a study suggested that a periodic upwelling of cooler waters in the Pacific was limiting the rise.\nHowever this latest work, published in the journal Science, shifts the focus from the Pacific to the Atlantic and Southern oceans.\nThe team, lead by Prof Ka-Kit Tung from the University of Washington, US, says there is now evidence that a 30-year current alternately warms and cools the world by sinking large amounts of heat beneath these deep waters.\nThey've used observations from a network of devices called Argo floats that sample the oceans down to 2,000 metres.\nThe researchers say that there was another hiatus between 1945 and 1975 due to this current taking down the heat, that led to fears of a new ice age.\nFrom 1976 though, the cycle flipped and contributed to the warming of the world, as more heat stayed on the surface.\nBut since the year 2000, the heat has been going deeper, and the world's overall temperatures haven't risen beyond the record set in 1998.\n\"The floats have been very revealing to us,\" said Prof Tung.\n\"I think the consensus at this point is that below 700 metres in the Atlantic and Southern oceans [they are] storing heat and not the Pacific.\"\nA key element in this new understanding is the saltiness of the water. The waters in the Atlantic current coming up from the tropics are saltier because of evaporation. This sinks more quickly and takes the heat down with it.\nEventually though, the salty water melts enough ice in Arctic waters to lower the saline level, slowing down the current and keeping the heat near the surface.\n\"Before 2006 the saltiness was increasing, this indicated that the current was speeding up,\" said Prof Tung.\n\"After 2006, this saltiness is diminishing but it's still above the long-term average. Now it is slowly slowing down.\n\"Once it gets below the long-term average, then it is the next period of rapid warming.\"\nAs well as the data from the Argo floats, Prof Tung has also examined the Central England Temperature record, that dates back over 350 years. He believes that this confirms the regular 70-year cycles of warm and cold spells.\nThis historic pattern, he says, could extend the current period of pause.\n\"We probably may have another 10 years, maybe shorter as global warming itself is melting more ice and ice could flood the North Atlantic, but historically we are in the middle of the cycle.\"\nSeveral other researchers in this field acknowledge the Tung analysis is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests the Atlantic has a role in the pause.\nProf Reto Knutti from the ETH Zurich has recently published a review of all the current theories on the hiatus.\n\"I see the studies as complementary, and they both highlight that natural variability in ocean and atmosphere is important in modifying long term anthropogenic trends,\" he said.\n\"A better understanding of those modes of variability is critical to understand past changes (including differences between models and observations during the hiatus period) as well as predicting the future, in particular in the near term and regionally, where variability dominates the forced changes from greenhouses gases.\"\nOther scientists say that the Atlantic hypothesis is interesting but a much longer range of observations is needed.\n\"We really don't have a lot of data,\" said Dr Jonathan Robson from the University of Reading, UK.\n\"So if there is this 60-year oscillation in the ocean, we haven't observed it all, basically we've observed the impact of it. We may have to wait 15-20 years to know what's going on.\"\nProf Tung believes that whatever the cause and the length of the pause, we are on a \"rising staircase\" when it comes to global temperatures that will become apparent when the Atlantic current switches again.\n\"At the end we will be on the rising part of the staircase, and the rate of warming there will be very fast, just as fast as the last three decades of the 20th Century, plus we are starting off at a higher plateau. The temperatures and the effects will be more severe.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.", "summary": "The hiatus in the rise in global temperatures could last for another 10 years, according to new research.", "id": "28870988"}

{"document": "He was also dealing them, and at one point faced a possible jail sentence.\nBorn in the Scottish new town of Cumbernauld, Ryan began experimenting with drugs when he was 12, initially because he was curious and had fallen in with likeminded friends.\n\"I tried everything - cocaine, Valium, ecstasy, speed, heroin... I'd go on benders for two or three days at a time, and I'd take five or 10 ecstasy tablets in one night,\" he says.\n\"From the age of 15 to 20 I took drugs every single day.\"\nThankfully for Ryan, everything changed when he was 20, and he has not touched drugs ever since. While the cynical may raise their eyebrows, Ryan, now 37, says he discovered God and quit overnight.\nWithout the drugs, he was able to get his life back, and aged 24 he launched a catering company called Regis Banqueting.\nToday the 13-year-old business has blue-chip clients including mobile phone network O2, luxury carmaker Bentley, and investment bank JP Morgan.\nWith drugs his main interest and income at the time, Ryan left school in Cumbernauld, 13 miles north-east of Glasgow, aged 16.\nFour years later he was dealing thousands of pounds worth of drugs a week, and if he continued he says it was clear that he would become a \"big time gangster drug dealer\".\nTrying to run away from his lifestyle, Ryan decided in 2000 to go to New Zealand for a year in search of a fresh start.\nBut it fell apart just two weeks after he arrived, when New Zealand customs intercepted a package of 100 ecstasy pills that Ryan had posted to himself from Scotland.\nFacing a jail term, he phoned a friend back in Scotland. She said that she would pray for him and suggested he do the same.\nRyan says: \"I thought 'you're off your head' but I decided to try it, and I got down beside my bed and I said, 'I don't believe that there is a God, but if you're real then show me that you're real and I'll believe in you.'\"\nOut on bail, Ryan had to go to the police station every two days, but his appetite for drugs was undiminished.\nIt was only when he met two female hitchhikers that things changed. The women took him out for lunch, then to church, and allowed him to move in to their home.\n\"That was when I thought there was maybe something to this because why would two complete strangers do that? That was the catalyst for change.\"\nRyan says that discovering his faith was fast, and the change immediate. Drugs suddenly lost all appeal, and he threw all the substances that he had into the sea, and has been clean ever since.\n\"I know most people who have been taking drugs don't have that experience. Most people do ok for a bit then they relapse. Everyone's journey is different but that was mine.\"\nWhile Ryan escaped jail time in New Zealand, his visa was revoked, and he returned to Scotland in May 2000.\nHe joined a church, the evangelical Freedom City Church in Cumbernauld, met his wife and got married.\nTo earn money he got a job working with drug and alcohol addicts, where he was able to draw on his own experience to try to help others to quit.\nHowever, when the funding for his role ran out a few years later he found himself without work. It was then that the opportunity to start his own business came about.\nHis church wanted a catering company to run the cafe attached to their conference centre on an ad hoc basis, and the then-pastor suggested Ryan might fit the bill.\nDespite having little to no catering experience he jumped at the chance and Regis Banqueting was formed. Ryan attended catering college alongside running the cafe and learned as he went along.\n\"I had to phone my mother-in-law to ask how you make steak pie,\" he says.\n\"I was young and naive.  If I knew what I know now, I probably wouldn't have started it.\"\nTo help Ryan expand the business into contract catering, the Princes Trust, the UK start-up support charity led by the Prince of Wales, gave him a \u00a35,000 loan.\nWhile Ryan says the first three years were tough, with him taking a salary of just \u00a36,000 in year one, over time the clients and contracts got bigger.\nCumbernauld-based Regis Banqueting now has 65 staff - 20 full-time and 40 part-time, many of whom are seasonal - and annual turnover is \u00a31.3m.\nMeanwhile, Ryan and the company have won a number of awards including the Royal Bank of Scotland's young business of the year crown, and director of the year from the Institute of Directors organisation.\nProf Eleanor Shaw, head of the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University of Strathclyde, says it is Ryan's motivation and enthusiasm that helps make him such a success.\n\"Catering is a really difficult market to be competitive in, but he has such energy,\" she says. \"He's very hardworking and is so motivated that it brushes off on everyone around him.\"\nLooking back on his troubled youth, Ryan says he knows that his life might have turned out very differently.\nAs a result he tries to help others who face addiction and poverty, for instance by employing former addicts and ex-offenders among his staff.\nHe is also in the process of starting another company, alongside Regis, that will focus on creating a brand of casual dining restaurants, the first to be launched in Glasgow next year. The plan is to expand across Scotland and the UK before going international.\n\"I say to my wife sometimes that it's amazing how we're making more money than a doctor or lawyer - and we're making sandwiches,\" says Ryan.\nFollow The Boss series editor Will Smale on Twitter @WillSmale1", "summary": "At his lowest point, Ryan Longmuir took drugs every day \"just to feel normal\".", "id": "38220079"}

We will continue to monitor the situation very closely\".\nFor the four years of the last \"World Cup cycle\", from 2011 to 2014, Fifa's six top tier Global Partners (as was - it is now five) paid a total of $177m (\u00c2\u00a3116m) annually, which would mean each partner paid roughly $30m a year for this status.\nTier one sponsor Sony decided not to renew its contract last year - it had been a Fifa partner since 2007, after signing a contract in 2005 worth $38m annually.\nOne publicity-savvy bookmaker has offered odds on which sponsor will be the first to pull out of its association with football's Swiss-based powerbrokers.\nIt has Visa as the favourites, followed by Hyundai-Kia, although none of Fifa's backers have said yet they are ending their deals. Russian gas firm Gazprom is bottom of the betting to leave, and indeed it has put out a statement saying the current situation will have \"no influence\" on its agreement.\nBut as the scandal is not likely to go away any time soon, what damage is being done to these well-known companies, some of whom have associations with Fifa stretching back decades?\n\"This is disastrous for the main core group of big Fifa sponsors. For them, this is a major issue,\" says Anastasia Kourovskaia, a brands expert at agency Millward Brown.\n\"The idea of sponsorship is to transfer the goodwill that supporters feel for the sport, to the benefit of a brand's equity.\"\nShe suggests that the big seven corporations may have to position themselves at arms-length from Fifa, if they do not want to be hit by the fall-out from the sensational developments.\n\"The solution is to emphasise that they are supporting football for the benefit of the game itself, and the pleasure and challenge of winning and playing football, rather than Fifa as an organisation,\" she says. \"They have to differentiate themselves from Fifa's management.\"\nIn addition, she points out that as this is not the first scandal to hit Fifa, it might be a good time for the sponsors to form a committee of their own \"to ensure the ethical running of big global football events\".\nOne other unforeseen outcome of the furore may be that in future, potential sports sponsors may look to back smaller, grass-roots, events - which traditionally have been more complex and costly to back - rather than global blockbusters such as World Cups, which have a greater potential for scandal.\n\"This might be the tipping point that sees sponsors move away from events which are 'uniform' across the world, and towards more local events,\" she says.\nAdidas - the German sportswear firm has been supplying the official match ball for all Fifa World Cup tournament matches since 1970. Also involved in all other Fifa events, such as the Confederations Cup Brazil 2013, and the Fifa U-20 World Cups for women and men.\nCoca-Cola - the US soft drinks firm is one of the longest-standing corporate partners of Fifa, with a formal association since 1974 and an official sponsorship of the Fifa World Cup that began in 1978. Coca-Cola has had stadium advertising at every Fifa World Cup since 1950.\nGazprom - the Russian energy giant signed up with Fifa in 2013 as a partner for all competitions in the period of 2015 to 2018, including the 2018 Fifa World Cup, which is due to take place in Russia for the first time. (The firm is also an official partner of the Uefa Champions League 2012 to 2015).\nHyundai/Kia - the South Korean carmaker began its Fifa alliance in 1999, in a deal to sponsor 13 Fifa competitions including the 2002 World Cup, an agreement extended to the 2006 event. It again backed the 2010  World Cup and is now the official Automotive Partner of Fifa until 2022.\nVisa - the credit card company became a top-tier Fifa partner in 2007, taking over from rivals Mastercard in controversial circumstances, and recently extended its relationship until 2022.  It is a sponsor of five Fifa events this year, including the Women's World Cup in Canada.\nBudweiser - the US beverage has been a World Cup sponsor since the 1986 event in Mexico, and is the Official Beer of the tournament, with its product on sale in all stadiums at the finals, and it also sponsors the Man of the Match award at each game.\nMcDonald's - the American fast food chain has been a sponsor since the 1994 World Cup in the US. Its products are available at all matches in the finals tournament, and it also sponsors the World Cup Player Escort programme, in which children accompany the teams onto the pitch.\nMeanwhile, it appears that Nike, which is not an official Fifa sponsor (but does come up with clever marketing campaigns around the World Cup) has also been dragged into the furore, with the US Department of Justice questioning its deal with the Brazilian Football Association.\nThe American indictments state that an unidentified \"major US sportswear company\" is alleged to have been involved in the payment and receipt of bribes.\nThe Department of Justice did not name the firm, but Nike and the Brazilian football federation have been partners since a $400m sponsorship deal was signed back in 1996.\nNike did not confirm it was the company alluded to, but said it \"believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been co-operating, and will continue to co-operate, with the authorities.\"\nMeanwhile, the editor-in-chief of Dutch newspaper Nederlands Dagblad says he does not want to see any adverts from Fifa sponsors in his paper until they have \"converted\".\nAnd the sponsorship industry's trade body in Europe is taking a dim view of the arrests and indictments.\nThe European Sponsorship Association says that the developments \"underline the critical importance of transparency and high ethical standards in sport and in business\".\nThey said that sponsors did not want to be associated with alleged \"shady practices\" and were \"increasingly asking rights-owners tough questions on a range of compliance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues\".", "summary": "It has not been an easy week for the big multinational corporations that sponsor football's world governing body Fifa.", "id": "32912445"}
{"document": "He began broadcasting in the days of skiffle and was still at the microphone in the second decade of the 21st Century.\nMany of the most enduring acts in pop history kick-started their careers on one of his many radio shows.\nAnd, as presenter of Thank Your Lucky Stars, he introduced the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to a television audience.\nBrian Matthew was born in Coventry on 17 September 1928 into a musical family. His mother sang professionally while his father was the conductor of the local silver band.\nHis radio career began when he was serving with the Army in post-war Germany where he worked as a programme presenter and newsreader on  the British Forces Network, which broadcast to troops serving abroad.\nHe also developed something of a talent for acting and on leaving the Army, he went to Rada, securing a number of roles with the Old Vic Company. It was there that he met his wife, Pamela, whom he married in 1951.\nThere was a short time with Radio Netherlands Worldwide, the Dutch English language service, before he returned to the UK and took up a job as a milkman in his home city.\nMatthew was back behind a microphone in 1954 when the BBC recruited him as an announcer and producer. One of the programmes he hosted was Saturday Skiffle Club, later renamed Saturday Club, which went out on the BBC Light Programme on Saturday mornings.\nThe BBC virtually ignored the boom in popular music in the 1950s and Matthew's show quickly found an appreciative teenage audience.\nSkiffle, which was based on acoustic guitars and a variety of home-made instruments including tea chests and washboards, had a fleeting moment of fame with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, before it was swept away by rock and roll.\nWith bands such as Bill Hailey and the Comets from the US, and up-and-coming British performers like Adam Faith and the Shadows, the demand for pop music grew and Matthew's show was extended to two hours from the original 30 minutes.\nThe programme brought a British audience the music of a host of US stars, including Gene Vincent, the Everly Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis alongside emerging British talent. In later years the show would highlight performances by The Beatles, The Searchers and Manfred Mann.\nIn 1960, the BBC launched a Sunday morning show called Easy Beat and Matthew was drafted in to present that as well. By now he was the authentic voice of the pop music explosion that came to dominate the 1960s.\nA year later his audience finally put a face to the voice when he was recruited to present ITV's new pop show, Thank Your Lucky Stars. It featured bands such as The Beatles and the Rolling Stones miming to their latest single.  A guest DJ and three teenagers would also review new releases. This latter section of the show introduced Janice Nicholls whose \"Oi'll give it foive\" delivered in her strong Black Country accent, passed into folklore.\nBy the mid-1960s, the BBC's pop offering was looking rather dated alongside the competition from a fleet of pirate radio ships scattered around the coast of the UK. When the BBC finally caught up in 1967, with the launch of Radio 1, Easy Beat was dropped. Meanwhile, Matthew, who was approaching his 40s,  found himself dropped from Saturday Club in favour of former pirate DJ, Keith Skues.\nIn 1972 Matthew narrated a 12-part documentary for Radio 2 entitled The Beatles Story which was later repeated on 6 Music.\nMatthew later appeared on Radio 1 presenting My Top 12, a programme on which a guest star would be interviewed about his or her career and select 12 favourite tracks to make up an imaginary album.\nGuests reflected the whole range of popular music and included Brian Ferry, Keith Emerson, Joni Mitchell and Neil Diamond. Matthew also presented a regular easy listening show on weekday evenings for radio and, in 1978, began hosting the Radio 2 arts show Round Midnight.\nIn 1990, he took over Sounds of the 60s, the Radio 2 show with which he would always be indelibly linked. It gained a huge and appreciative audience of people who had been teenagers in the 1960s, as well as their children, tuning in to hear the opening bars of Foot Tapper, the Shadows recording that was the programme's theme tune.\nIn 2008, Matthew won a Sony Gold Award \"in recognition of a truly outstanding contribution to UK radio\".\nApart from a couple of breaks because of illness, Matthew continued to present the show until, in January 2017, the BBC announced that he was standing down because of ill-health and that his place would be taken by Tony Blackburn.\nThe Corporation found itself on the end of a backlash from loyal listeners and from Matthew himself, who attacked the BBC's handling of the matter.\n\"I was ready and willing and able to go back,\" he said, \"and they just said they are going to put the programme in the hands of other people.\n\"I enjoyed doing the show very much. I did it for 25 years. I feel very disconcerted, I must say.\"\nHe presented his final proper show on 25 February 2017 although a repeat of an earlier programme, with new links, was broadcast on 6 March.\nHe signed off his last broadcast in typical style. \"This is your old mate, Brian Matthew, saying that's your lot for this week.

{"document": "It was scrapped this week at the eleventh hour when the government removed it from parliament moments before it was due to be voted into law.\nUnder the proposal, which had already passed a first round of voting, it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could \"destroy, alter or subvert state institutions\" or \"damage national integrity or independence\".\nThis would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook, or receiving an email containing anti-government sentiment, could have faced up to 12 years in prison.\nThe law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos, pictures or recordings without the subject's consent, criminalise \"whistle-blowing\" under the crime of \"espionage\" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state, even if it was not classified.\nMinister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital, Luanda, that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision.\nBut many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists, who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was \"totalitarian\" and violated basic freedom of expression, played a role in the decision to abandon the law.\nUS-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have \"undercut both freedom of expression and information, and posed a severe threat to independent media, whistle-blowers, and investigative journalism\".\nWith most of Angola's traditional media controlled by the state, or owned by government ministers and their business associates, there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio.\nOpposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time, while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin.\nCivil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet, even though only 1% of Angolans have access to the web, to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites.\nIn recent months, several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook, where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public.\nAngolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium.\nMany are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity.\nThe introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest.\nIn an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to \"insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion\".\nOfficially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud.\nThe editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal.\n\"The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed,\" she told the BBC.\nSizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down.\n\"This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across.\" she said.\nHowever, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda.\nOrganised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime.\nBut following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square.\nAccording to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests.\nThey were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people.\nA spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted \"criminally\" and the police force was within its rights to respond.\n\"What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate,\" Ms Cutaia said.\nAlthough small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA.\n\"The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations,\" Ms Cutaia says.\n\"All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change.\n\"Most of all they want the right to be able to make their voices heard.\"", "summary": "In a rare climbdown, the Angolan government has withdrawn controversial legislation severely restricting how people use the internet.", "id": "13569129"}

A hard-working mum.\n\"Leading into London she was an athlete first and foremost. But after her son Reggie was born she was a mum who did athletics. That is a lovely example, look at her, how she changed, she became just a mum with a hobby.\n\"The World Championship medal in 2015 and the Olympic medal at Rio was more about doing something for her son; her son would see that and have an affinity with it. He is very sporty, and can throw a broom handle thinking it's a javelin.\n\"He has seen his mum, whatever memory he may or may not have, he will have experienced what his mum's reputation will always be.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I met Jess when she was nine. I was teaching on summer camps at the time and I saw this kid who stood out from her peers because she was just that bit quicker.\n\"She only came down because her friend came down but she stuck with it and the friend went in a different direction.\n\"Jess kept exceeding and exceeding expectations, people criticised her for being too small, said she'd never make it. They said my coaching was no good. But I was like 'no, come and see this kid, what she does, she is tenacious, a highly-competitive individual'.\n\"She can be a pain, she is always ultra competitive. She gets it from her mum, even lobbing a drinks bottle into a bin from five metres.\n\"Her best quality is her ability to be ultra competitive but be incredibly grounded and modest. She is critical of herself. She does not say 'look at me, the great I am'. She is modest and strives to be better and has an incredible work ethic. You could not ask for any more. She got her physicality from her parents and add that to the work ethic and competitive bit; bring all that together and you have lightning in a bottle.\n\"She has always been sassy and was a cheeky little kid. But she has that determination to do better and never be satisfied with her performance.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"For me, the highlight of her career wasn't London 2012, but coming back from pregnancy and winning the World Championship in Beijing in 2015.\n\"Number two would coming back from three stress fractures in her foot and winning her first World Championship in 2009 because that was potentially a career-threatening injury. The home Olympics was big but in my perspective overcoming adversity was better.\n\"London was superb, but a bit surreal because the crowd were so supportive. It wasn't quite the same pressurised environment. Normally on the first day of a heptathlon it is three men a dog, but it was packed.\n\"I have two great memories from London. The first was when she was introduced in the last heat of the 800m. They went down the line and when the announcer got to lane eight - Jess' lane - he was drowned out by the noise of the crowd.\n\"The second was so many people staying in the stadium for the medal ceremony and singing the national anthem. It was the first gold medal and the first time the stadium heard the anthem.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"After Rio, I said 'go and take two or three months and make sure you're happy with the decision'. There will be no comeback, no Frank Sinatra moment, it won't be that, even though you get good odds for her to compete at Tokyo... the bookies were offering 10-1.\n\"She had the shortest competitive preparation for Rio with injuries and it was not the most sensible competitive programme to try and retain an Olympic title. It had been a struggle, three injuries to get over and her body was not as forgiving as it was. She had this in mind when she made a judgement call about competing at the World Championships in London in 2017.\nFind out how to get into athletics with our special guide.\n\"It was time. In fairness there is a new generation of British athletes coming through and the hope is they can step up and succeed. It's their moment, no need to dwell on the past, her time has been.\n\"I will miss it, I like going to major championships, I like the buzz. But I have a whole new crop and hopefully have one or two who can make it.\"\n\"If you look at somebody who in a career has won a medal at the youngest stage and gone all the way through to winning an Olympic medal, the changes that you had in that lifetime, that defines a career.\n\"To come back from three injuries and to win a world title, again that would define a career. To win a home Olympics, again that would define you, To come back after pregnancy as a mum and how organise time and win a world title and Olympic medal, anyone of those individually would all define a career. To have done all four, that is staggering.\n\"She is better than Daley Thompson, he never gave birth and came back and won, he trained and trained.

{"document": "More than a new way of playing video games, a cynic might say.\nSpecial Report: The Technology of Business\nDigital death of a business card?\nMobile advertisers want your phone\nRinsing your reputation the online way\nMobile working comes of age\nUsing voice to give your app the edge\nBut Microsoft - a company that may well spend more on R&D than any other business - believes its strategy is paying off, and the proof is the XBox Kinect system.\nOn a visit to the company's headquarters, I had a chance to see some of the projects that Microsoft scientists at its laboratories in Redmond, in Beijing and in Cambridge, England, believe will change the way we see computers.\nAnd the striking thing about what Microsoft's research chief Craig Mundie picked to show off to a group of technology journalists was that almost all of them involved Kinect.\nThe system which turns a player's body into a games controller was developed with the help of seven different research groups at the company's three main labs, some working on voice recognition, others on motion sensors and a range of other technologies.\nNow they are looking at what Kinect could do next.\nWe saw a system which would allow two people to see different images on the same screen, their eyes tracked by the Kinect camera.\nOther scientists showed off ways that the camera could capture objects and people in 3D, which might have applications in future telepresence systems.\nAnd there was plenty of work on avatars, for use in either games or in video-conferencing. Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person.\nCraig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off.\n\"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\"\nBut Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs.\nEver since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream.\nPeter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking.\nProfessor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis.\nHe cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing.\n\"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\"\nBut he thinks the long-term research is equally important.\n\"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize.\nHis boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example.\nThere is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\"\nIt is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line.\nBig, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft.\n\"We don't feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\"\nAnd he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end.\n\"I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\"\nMicrosoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.", "summary": "If you spent $9bn a year on research and development and employed 900 of the world's top computer scientists to come up with new ideas, what would you expect in return?", "id": "12570045"}

It is just really unfortunate that it has always been my left foot.\"\nA top-two finish in Sunday's 5,000m at the British Championships, doubling as Olympic trials, would secure a place in the Great Britain team heading to Rio - a fitting reward for persistence in the face of adversity.\nAs McColgan relates the \"long process\" of recovery from the initial ankle break, to further surgery last July, to jogging again, to issues with \"compensatory injuries\" and additional nerve problems, it is not hard to understand her surprise at the form she takes to Birmingham.\nThe Scottish 3,000m steeplechase record holder has ditched the hurdles and water jumps to protect her vulnerable ankle and run personal bests in the 3,000m and 5,000m - the latter in her first track outing for 22 months - to achieve the Olympic qualifying standard.\n\"It has been an absolute blessing to come back as quickly as I have,\" she told BBC 5 live's Sports Panel recently. \"I honestly thought this year would be just about slowly building things up and just being happy to be running again.\n\"But my form has come back quite quickly. I put a lot of work in on the cross-trainer and in the gym and pool. I did everything I could apart from running.\n\"It is nice to be back running PBs over all distances and I am ready to race the trials now.\"\nSteve Cram, BBC Sport's athletics commentator, saw first hand what McColgan went through at a winter training camp for some of Britain's distance athletes in early February.\n\"I have got a lot of time for Eilish,\" Cram told BBC Scotland. \"I was with her in Kenya and she was still struggling then.\n\"But she never gives up on it. Everyone else was going out and doing their miles on the trails and Eilish was not able to run much at that point, but she was going into the gym and running on the machines.\n\"She threw herself into that rehab with an incredible amount of energy. Her motivation stayed high and that is why she has come out the other end of it.\n\"We have got three or four girls who are doing well at the 5K this year, but if Eilish can re-produce her form at the trials, hopefully she will be in Rio.\"\nFellow Scottish 5,000m runners Steph Twell (14:59.00) and Laura Whittle (15:08.58) have both run faster this year than the 15:09.94 McColgan posted in California in early May.\nBut, given her rapid progress since returning to the track, you wouldn't bet against her, even if she admits the reward of an Olympics spot brings added pressures.\n\"Preparing to put on a GB vest is completely different for me to competing in a Diamond League or a smaller race,\" she explained.\n\"The Olympics is the pinnacle of sport, it is what you spend years training for and dreaming of.\n\"It is definitely a lot more intense and there are a lot more nerves on the start line knowing the opportunity to make the team is up for grabs.\n\"It is like another level of competition up, but it is one you have prepared for.\n\"You are still running and racing and doing exactly what you have trained to do. But the whole environment is a little bit more pressurised.\"\nMcColgan has already competed at an Olympics, missing out on the final of the 3,000m steeplechase in London four years ago.\nShe concedes switching to the 5,000m so close to Rio is \"quite a scary change\"- particularly in such a competitive event. But, considering the alternative, the risk-reward decision became clear.\n\"I can run and get through the aches and pains of my ankle, but the impact of jumping in the steeplechase is just too much of a risk,\" she said.\n\"It is my favourite event, but if it meant I had to sit on the sidelines for another year, I think mentally it would have been very, very difficult.\n\"I just love running and it would have been silly to risk it to try to make the team for Rio. I just wouldn't be confident mentally.\"\nIf McColgan requires any further inspiration on the road to Rio, she only has to look at her coach, and mother, Liz McColgan-Nuttall.\nThe 1991 world 10,000m champion, two-time Commonwealth gold medallist and London Marathon winner, who also won Olympics silver, was famous for her belligerence and grit.\n\"My mum is a huge inspiration to me,\" says her daughter. \"So many people come up to me and say 'I used to watch your mum running 25 years ago, it is amazing to see you doing it'.\n\"She is still inspiring people today. It is really nice to hear that about someone who's not just your coach but your mum.\n\"There is something very different about her persona. She is very motivated and hard-driven.

{"document": "Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets.\nNeeding 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four.\nBut they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4.\nThe tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out.\nHowever, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday.\nAfter England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining.\nBut the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes.\nRashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six.\nThe door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs.\nPakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled.\nMoeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson.\nEngland sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets.\nMakeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot.\nHowever, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012.\nIn Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings.\nAnd Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad.\nEngland captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory.\n\"We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,\" he said. \"I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket.\n\"The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.\n\"We played a good game and so did Pakistan. They were a bit sloppy today and we put them under pressure.\n\"It was brilliant from Adil Rashid who I think got some unfair criticism after the first innings. He's a very fine bowler.\"\nOverall this was a vastly improved overseas display from England, who were whitewashed 3-0 on their last tour of the United Arab Emirates and have not won any of their last three away series.\nIn contrast to their limp displays with the bat in the 2012 series against Pakistan and more recent overseas disappointments in Australia and West Indies, England's victory charge was built on a superb total of 598-9 declared in their first innings.\nResuming on 569-8, England added 29 quick runs in the morning session, with Rashid out for 12 in his maiden Test innings.\nBut the innings hinged on Cook's magnificent 263, the longest-ever innings by an Englishman, compiled over days two, three and four.\nEngland's pace bowlers also showed that they could be threatening on the dusty, spin-friendly tracks of the UAE, with Ben Stokes taking 4-57 in the first innings and Anderson also taking four wickets over the course of the match.\nWith England's new-look opening partnership of Cook and Moeen adding 113 for the first wicket in the first innings, and the under-pressure Bell scoring a half-century at number three, England will head to Dubai knowing that many parts of their team are in good working order.\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan: \"Many people will be watching and listening and wondering why they can't continue and I agree with them. This goes back to last night when they came off and you wonder was there a real threat to the players then. It shouldn't take the shine off what has been a good day from England and Adil Rashid.\"\nFormer England spinner Graeme Swann: \"I am proud of the way England played. The only way they were going to win this game was to persevere and stick it at - and they did that even though they didn't get the result in the end.\n\"I'm really pleased for Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali who copped a load of stick in the first innings. I don't buy into the Pakistan time-wasting because anyone in their shoes would do the same.\"\nRichard Oelmann: Umpires had no choice with current rules - Rules need changing though. England would have done the same as Pakistan if positions reversed.\nChris Tudor: England have been 'saved by the bell' loads of times. No-one complained when play stopped at EXACTLY 6:30pm at Cardiff in 2009.\nJonathan Wilson: England robbed. Cook out off a no ball delayed things. Lbw in Pakistan inns not given.

{"document": "\"The most scared I've ever been,\" says Scotland's open-side flanker.\nThe setting is a building in Queenstown on New Zealand's south island -  a holiday resort about an hour and a half from Dipton, the farming country where Hardie was born and reared.\nLegend has it that there was a fire in Lockhart's place in the late 1800s. Three generations of the family perished.\nOnly a girl called Mary survived - and she haunts the place to this day. Many Kiwis have gone there over the years and many talk of the sense of foreboding that exists behind that main door.\nHardie's now one of them. Chilled to the bone, he says. \"Never going back. Never ever.\"\nThe fact that Lockhart's gaff is part of a theme park called Fear Factory - New Zealand's equivalent of the Edinburgh Dungeons - is neither here nor there to Hardie.\nWhen you ask him what's the most tense he has ever been in his life, you don't hear tales of his early years playing for the Southland Stags in Invercargill, or the time he came face-to-face with some assassin in Super Rugby.\nHe mentions the Fear Factory instead. \"I went with my girlfriend about a year ago,\" he said. \"It's pitch dark and you have to follow this red light around these alleyways.\n\"You don't know where you're going then these creatures start jumping out at you. Terrifying. Once was enough.\n\"I don't normally go in for that kind of stuff, but I did a bungee jump once and I'm not doing that again either. Give me a hard game of rugby instead.\"\nAfraid of the dark? It doesn't tally with Hardie's tough persona.\nHardie, 27, is a strange animal - a Scotland international who has never played an international in Scotland, his five caps being won in Turin, Paris, Gloucester, Newcastle and at Twickenham in that epic World Cup quarter-final against Australia.\nA measure of his success since his sudden elevation to the Scotland squad in the summer has been the silencing of the debate surrounding his arrival. One minute, he was a Highlander who wanted to be an All Black and the next a Scot - with a granny from Fife - in the World Cup team.\nHis ascent jarred, but the quality of his game has overtaken everything. He was terrific at the World Cup, his dynamism and cleverness at the breakdown helping to protect and unleash the rapiers in his backline.\n\"It's one of the best things I've done in my life,\" he says of his move from what he calls the \"comfort zone\" of Highlanders rugby. \"Having won a cap, I owed it to Scotland to stay here and playing for Edinburgh has been a really good decision.\n\"I got into too much of a routine in New Zealand and it was good to get out of it. I needed something different in my career - a change in scenery, new players, new coaches.\n\"I love the Highlanders, but it was time to try something else. But it was nerve-racking coming here. It was like going back to school again. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.\"\nHe talks about that day against the Wallabies, but only briefly. \"We had to suck it up.\" That's it?\" No torment, no ghosts?\n\"Nah. We have to learn the lessons, that's all. Nothing else we can do.\"\nNobody should mistake the emotionless matter-of-fact response to a heartbreaking loss as indifference. It's just the Kiwi in him. What's done is done. You move forwards, you don't look backwards.\nWhat about Scotland's habit of losing big games at the death, though? There was that Australia match and the Italy game in the Six Nations just before. There was the France game in the 2014 Six Nations, lost to a penalty two minutes from the end despite France losing eight line-outs and losing the possession and territory battle by a wide margin.\nScottish sides, routinely, come up with novel ways of shooting themselves in the foot.\nMost recently, Glasgow Warriors lost a Champions Cup match to Northampton in the closing minutes, a defeat that put paid to their European hopes, and Hardie's Edinburgh team collapsed close to the finishing line against Grenoble last weekend, a late capitulation which led to them exiting the European Champions Cup.\nYou keep hitting him with this stuff and it doesn't put a dent on him. Zero points scored in the second half against France in the 2015 Six Nations. Another zero in the second half against England and yet another zero against Ireland.\nOnly three points scored in the second half against Italy despite having 61% possession and spending 62% of the second period in the opposition half.\nHe says he doesn't know much about what happened before he arrived on these shores. \"As a kid, I used to watch the Six Nations, but not live,\" he said.\n\"I'd watch it in the morning. I've always known that it was a fantastic thing. But that stuff about what happened in previous seasons doesn't bother me.\n\"I mean, we were points down against Samoa in the World Cup and we won it late on and that was as big a game as any.\n\"I don't think there's a mental barrier. I'm new to it all, but I can't sense anything like that.\n\"I don't see any fear, there's no blockage. We scored lots of tries at the World Cup. Lots of line-breaks. I think there's a lot of improvement.\"\nHis knowledge of the Calcutta Cup is from across the other side of the world. He's never played in it, watched it in the flesh, or even watched it live on television. There's a hurricane coming his way on 6 February and he knows it.\n\"The boys have told me about it, but I know that Scotland v England is massive, it's one of the great fixtures,\" he said. \"I'm not a great watcher of other teams, but there's a lot of change going on with England. New coach, lots of new players, lots of excitement. They've got a fresh start and they'll be fizzing.\n\"This is why you play rugby, for the pressure, for games like this, for tournaments like the Six Nations.\n\"Everything is in our own hands. Whatever happened before, happened. I see a hungry bunch of boys with all the talent you need to do well and a set of coaches who are working night and day to try to make it happen.\"\nIn the midst of all this, there is the unflappable son of Dipton. \"It's about the length of the three rugby pitches. There's about 30 houses, a dairy, a wool shop and a garage. Population of a couple of hundred.\"\nAnd, on 6 February, he says, they will all become honorary Scots.

{"document": "From implementing plans to further grow their companies, to dealing with the likely problems that will need to be overcome, this is the time of year when forward planning is the centre of attention.\nHere some of the best business leaders - and rock music legends - profiled in 2015 for the BBC's The Boss slot share their thoughts on running or setting up a business in 2016.\nHave a clear objective. Understand the DNA of your business.\nWhat you put in is what you get out. Do not take \"no\" or \"can't\" as an answer.\nSocialise and network within your industry.\nGet rid of all your loser friends. You know the ones - they drink too much, they get high. And like vampires they will suck the life blood out of you.\nThat may not leave you with very many friends, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in business your friends will not be much help.\nYou're too young and not rich enough to take vacations. Work, it's a good word.\nThere are many reasons people get into business. For me it was creative pursuit, and being a creator of my own destiny.\nYou need to build your business the right way for the right reasons. If it is just for the money then you will only have a business short term.\nNew companies are hungry for cash, so anything you are making will go straight back into the business. And often the founder, who is working 120 hours a week, is the last person to see any returns for a long time from their hard yards.\nYet these are the businesses that succeed, and in the long run are the ones that are truly successful. By contrast, firms that are stripped of their cash to \"fund\" the lifestyle of their owners are very short-lived.\nBuilding a business on passion and hard work, and surrounding yourself with great people, is the recipe for success.\nBe digitally minded - digital is a vital part of any business now, and it goes beyond just having a good website and being on social media.\nConsumers want a digital experience across all elements of any business they engage with, and they want it to be seamless.\nDiversify - think about how your business can grow and diversify in to new areas, but always ensure these new areas reflect your customer demographic.\nI always look for new ways to evolve the brand, and in early 2016 we will be launching Rabbit, our own dating app.\nListen - this is a tip that's relevant every year, never stop listening to your customers.  They are the most vital source of information and their feedback is invaluable.\nWhen leading your business, focus on what makes you different - not what is generic.\nThis allows your team, customers and suppliers to all \"buy in\" to why your business matters, and why it is worth joining, and staying and working with.\nIt also means that everyone is better focused on your competitive advantage and unique proposition.\nTalk about what makes your business what it is.\nCollective wisdom says that goal-setting, planning and managing your time wisely are critical for success.\nHowever, there is a secret formula to achieving objectives that is widely overlooked - do what you dread first!\nTackle the task, have the conversation, do the mundane that you least want to do at the beginning of your day.\nIt takes incredible discipline to start with the unexciting, but when you complete the task, you avoid using psychic energy towards fretting about what you're avoiding.\nYou will open yourself up to more inspiration and imagination and find more time to accomplish greatness.\nIn business, no two weeks are ever the same, but if your company has been in existence for a year or more, then analyse and learn from the previous 12 months.\nIdentify the surge periods and the quiet moments, and make sure that you have the proper staffing levels in place, as well as being ready to pre-empt problems and capitalise upon perennial opportunities.\nAs they grow, far too many businesses become rigidly hierarchical - the distance growing between senior management and the staff on the frontline.\nBeyond the obvious fact that layers of bureaucracy are an enemy to innovation, listening to all staff members, irrespective of their position, is crucial. Not only does such engagement prove good for morale, but the insights that staff can offer could be the thing that changes your business for the better.\nHaving landed a big contract or launched a new service, it is entirely understandable that maintaining this new workload becomes a priority for a business. However, it should not do so to the complete detriment of maintaining company growth.\nKeep on implementing new business strategies and growth plans at all times. It may seem an obvious point to make, but so many companies become wholly dependent on one big client or project that they suddenly find themselves in deep trouble should they lose the work.\nSetting up your own business requires enormous focus, drive and ambition, coupled with an incredibly hard work ethic.\nYou need funding, and you need relentless energy. Charm and wit help.\nYou also need to have a decent pair of rose tinted glasses to hand as if you knew all the pitfalls before you started you probably wouldn't do it.\nBut my one piece of advise is that outside legal and finance issues - don't listen to anyone, don't read business books, and do things your own way.\nTechnology and new ideas are changing the world faster than people can become experts in it. Don't follow the crowd - think for yourself, be different and break the mould.\nThe most important things when starting a business are - don't lie, don't pretend, and don't mislead your executives and the masses. And be passionate about the mission, have an innovative mind, and be totally honest in implementing your vision.\nHiring the best team is a matter of luck. Bosses must keep their eyes open not to allow politics, dishonesty and indiscipline. Anybody who gets involved with these three, should be sent home immediately. In my experience, referrals are the best source of fine personnel.\nHow long does it take for positive returns? Management is about making things happen, managing changes.\nIf the vision is innovative and supported by all requisites, i.e. finances, production planning, and strong administration, then success needs short gestation.\nInnovation is not only required for product, but also for administrative and financial systems. Slow progress can be tolerated, but negativity beyond a short space of time - in spite of the excellent management team - should indicate the time is ready to pull the plug.\nThere ought to be constant innovation in both product, resources and management. Without personal commitment and understanding of people's psyche, the best can fail. A successful entrepreneur needs divine grace, commitment to the cause, discipline and courage.\nEntrepreneurs have a different level of risk taking.\nIn life we all have a risk threshold. There are people for whom not having secured their regular monthly salary cheque is daunting.\nYou have to believe in yourself, and then you have just got to go for it.\nDepending on where you are on the risk register separates the very calculated \"I need to know all the answers\" type of person, from the 'I've got a good gut feel about this, I'm just going to give it a go' person. To be honest, the later one is the kind of person I am. I'll have a go.\nI don't take on unnecessary risk. But if you want dead certs they don't come your way. They don't exist.\nReconsider your marketing. If your marketing is the same as others in your sector, you're doing it wrong.\nMake sure that your customer can work out the value for money. If they can't, you don't deserve to retain them.\nThink of different things you can do with your business that are not just about making money.", "summary": "As 2016 arrives, business leaders around the world are now focusing intently on their aims and challenges for the next 12 months.", "id": "35095267"}
{"document": "And even one of those three times  - when it bought 250 million chocolate selection boxes from Woolworths following its  collapse - was a deliberate ploy to attract the retailer's customers to its stores.\nIt's a story that reflects just how Poundland, despite the cheap and cheerful image,  is a tightly managed business.\nPoundland might look a bit basic - the ultimate in pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap - but this is a sophisticated firm with big plans for expansion. And its growth is part of a wider UK success story: the unstoppable rise of the discount retailers.\nOverall, the discount sector - including Poundland and its smaller rivals such as Poundworld and Poundstretcher, as well as the  fast-growing supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl - has grown 48% over the past five years, according to retail research firm The Local Data Company.\nThis compares to the slower 34% expansion of the big four supermarket chains - Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury - over the same period.\nIn fact, last year discount stores grew twice as fast as the big four supermarkets with each chain opening an average of 33 shops compared to the 16 opened by each of the bigger players.\nThis growth in a much improved economy seems surprising, but analysts believe the recession started a much more fundamental shift.\nMaureen Hinton, global research director for retail research firm Conlumino, says the careful habits initially borne of necessity have now become entrenched, with people realising they don't have to pay a lot to get good quality products.\nShe also credits the straightforward everyday pricing strategy of the discounters, compared to the \"opaque\" costs of their bigger rivals for their continuing popularity.\n\"There's a genuine honesty with pound stores. People have discovered there's the opportunity to buy good stuff at low prices so why pay more?\" she says.\nPoundland's customer data backs this up. Far from a shop just for people struggling to make ends meet, it claims to have successfully converted the middle class with a quarter of its customers now from the \"AB\" demographic - the wealthier end of the population.\nThe discounters are also benefitting from a backlash against their bigger rivals: they're are seen as a welcome outsider, says Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London.\n\"The cheap environment, low staffing and basic shop fit outs all help. People think there's no danger here and let their guard down,\" he says.\nAnd conversely, because customers believe that there's no hidden agenda they spend more.\n\"The no gimmicks, no frills, 'here we are saving money' message means people buy a lot more just because no one is trying to convince them to do it,\" he adds.\nIn reality, he says people overestimate their ability to understand pricing, with the low pricing creating \"a level of euphoria and excitement\" that interferes with rational decision making, with \"bargain\" signs helping to create a sense of urgency.\n\"We are hardwired to feel more euphoric, the hunter gatherer instinct pushes us to buy with our shopping driven by missing out rather than acquiring what we need.\"\nTo take advantage of this, most of the discount stores stock a smaller constantly changing range on top of standard staples.\nChris Edwards, the boss of Poundworld, says its bestselling products  are \"everyday grocery items\", including baby wipes, crisps and chocolate.\nBut he says the chain, which has 280 shops nationwide, each week changes 500 of the 5,000 items it stocks to \"keep up with trends\", such as a range of Minions products to tie in with the forthcoming film release, and give customers \"new and exciting offers\".\nThe chain has also recently launched an online shop, aimed at expanding its reach.\nPoundland's Mr McCarthy says it is \"reasonably well advanced\" with similar plans, but it is also aiming to rapidly expand its physical presence.\nIt is using the funds from last year's \u00c2\u00a3750m flotation on the London Stock Exchange to open more stores with a bullish long term target of opening 1,000 UK stores up from its current network of over 500 stores across the UK and Ireland.\nA \u00c2\u00a355m deal to buy smaller rival 99p Stores and convert their shops into Poundlands, which is currently being reviewed by The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), would dramatically hasten its growth.\nAnd in contrast to what you'd expect, Mr McCarthy says the \"good times\" are actually much better for sales.\n\"We've been going for 25 years and seen two recessions. In good times people feel more confident and go on more shopping trips which means we get more business\".\nHe is equally upbeat about the firm's growth prospects, pointing to the success of US discount chain Dollar Tree, which has been going for half a century, for proof of Poundland's potential longevity.\nBut others are less certain, warning that the growth of the discounters has an obvious limit. \"If there are five pound shops on the high street, people are not going to spend five times as much. They are in danger of reaching a peak,\" warns Ms Hinton.\nStill, it remains hard to resist the lure of the bargain. Mr McCarthy admits that even he is not immune to the store's charms - describing it as a \"Pandora's box treasure trove\".\nHe buys phone charges, Toblerone chocolate bars and biographies. \"It's very difficult not to be compelled to buy,\" he says.", "summary": "During his nine years at the helm of Poundland, says chief executive Jim McCarthy, the discount chain has sold a product at a loss just three times.", "id": "33155628"}

But there were wide local variations within the capital. In Kensington and Chelsea, only 59% got their first preference, while in Barking and Dagenham it was 91%.\nThis comes against a backdrop of an extra 900 applications in the capital this year.\nThe crisis has been precipitated mainly by a booming birth-rate, partly by immigration and by families moving specifically to be near popular schools.\nThe demand for school places has risen steeply in Harrow, which has some very good primary schools. It was predicted to be 12% over capacity by this September but the council said it had worked really hard to ensure there are enough places for Harrow children this year.\nA spokesman said the crush Harrow was seeing now was very likely to affect other areas around the country soon.\nInitial results from a Press Association survey of town halls shows families in some areas are more likely to gain a place at their top choice than in others.\nResults from Birmingham show 84.7% of children starting reception have got a place at their first preference, while 94.8% got one of their listed choices. Around one in 20 applicants - 826 children - were given a school that was not one of their preferred options. A further 3.3% - 532 youngsters - have been offered a school outside the city.\nFigures from East Sussex show 84.68% got their first choice, while in Southampton the percentage was 85.4%.\nIn Derbyshire, 93.4% of youngsters received their first pick, in Torbay it was 86.2%, Bristol was 84% - up from 82% last year, and in Cornwall it was 90.7%.\nIn Kent the figure was was 85.81%, up slightly from 84.9% last year.\nLabour and the National Association of Head Teachers also blame the coalition government's free-school policy, which has allowed some new schools to be opened in areas that already have surplus places.\nAt the same time, the ability of local authorities to plan for population surges has been reduced by regulations requiring any new schools to be either an academy or a free school, rather than a council school.\nNAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said: \"We have a balkanised system with authorities, academies and central government taking decisions in isolation.\"\nHe added: \"There is a desperate need for long-term planning that spans all sectors. With the massive increase in pupil numbers and over-stretched budgets, we cannot afford inefficiency and conflict.\"\nThe Local Government Association said the escalating places shortage was one of the key areas that needed to be tackled by the next government.\nEarlier this month, it said schools were \"reaching their limits and could soon run out of space and money for extra places\" and there would be a need for an extra 880,000 pupils at a cost of \u00c2\u00a312bn.\nThe Conservatives blame Labour for the problem saying the party \"cut over 200,000 primary school places - and even ignored official warnings to provide extra school places after a baby boom\".\nA spokesman added: \"The Conservatives have created over 400,000 school places. There are fewer children in overcrowded primary schools and, most importantly, one million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010.\"\nLabour points out that under the Conservative-Lib Dem administration the number of infant children in classes with more than 30 pupils has more than trebled from 31,265 in 2010 to 102,615 in 2015.\nShadow education secretary Tristram Hunt blamed the Conservatives for spending \"hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money on a few free schools in areas where there are no shortages of places\".\nBut Natalie Evans, director of New Schools Network, said: \"Over 90% of primary free schools opened or approved to open are in areas where new school places are needed. But they are also offering new choices in areas of low standards.\"\nLiberal Democrat schools minister David Laws said: \"It's astonishing that Labour and the Conservatives won't properly fund these children.  It will be impossible to provide a place for every child and raise standards unless we protect education budgets.\"\nTy Goddard, co-founder of think-tank Education Foundation, said England's vast education property estate could be used with more imagination, but called for the parties to work together on solving the school places issue.

{"document": "The world changed on 6 August 1945. Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since.\nBack then, the US was the only nation with \"the bomb\".\nThe story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea.\nThe big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran.\nAll sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There's talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough.\nSo why is it judged so important to stop Iran?\nI asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK's representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided.\nHe said: \"If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East.\n\"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region.\"\nSir John told me: \"If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons.\n\"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship.\n\"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East.\"\nIt's not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran.\nThe events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease.\nAyatollah Khomeini's triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah.\nThe years of blatant Western interference were over.\nRuhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran. He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar.\nArrested in 1962 by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero.\nExiled in 1964, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah.\nIn January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph.\nThere was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life.\nIslamic law was introduced across the country.\nThe new religious leadership inherited a nuclear research programme, but consistently denies expanding it with the aim of making \"the bomb\".\nThe big powers have never accepted that, pointing instead to all the Iranian effort to produce highly-enriched uranium in the quantities you could only need to build a bomb, as well as the secrecy and alleged concealment of so much activity which is specifically outlawed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.\nYears of pressure applied by sanctions and negotiations to find a way forward have now reached a point where agreement could - just could - be possible.\nI spoke to Ariane Tabatabai, of Georgetown University, who, like me, has been in Vienna to follow what is supposed to be the endgame in these talks.\nShe told me: \"Ultimately, the negotiations are about making sure that Iran's nuclear programme remains peaceful and to do that it needs to provide a set of assurances and that would mean Iran scaling back some of its nuclear activities.\n\"It will also provide more transparency to the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that everything is essentially under constant monitoring, with enhanced access given to its facilities so the international community can verify that Iran is holding its end of the bargain.\"\nWhich brings us neatly to the unanswerable question: Is the Iranian leadership ready to make a bargain?\nIt could be, partly to pacify those Iranians fed up with sanctions which help cripple their economy and symbolise isolation from a fast-developing world they yearn to be part of.\nProfessor Ali Ansari, historian of Iran at St Andrews University, pointed me to another of the country's ambitions, which is to recover some of the global respect which Iran believes it is due.\n\"What the Iranians are after is a degree of respect as a country that considers itself a great power - certainly in the region - that has not had a good time in the last century or so.\n\"The real pride and achievement is that they have developed what they've considered to be an indigenous nuclear industry.\n\"One of the arguments many people have made is that an Islamic government wouldn't be scientifically advanced.\n\"Well for the Iranians, you know, this is, sort of proof that it actually can be, if they put their mind to it.\"\nBut Prof Ansari is far from certain that a deal can be done, and - even if it is - that it will hold.\nAnd Sir John, from all his years negotiating with Iran, is blunt: \"Whenever you buy a carpet in Iran, you have to buy it two, three times over.\n\"You sometimes feel that is the same in the nuclear negotiations as well. There is an Iranian saying that the real negotiation only begins once the agreement is signed.\n\"They will always come back for more. Even if we get an agreement - it doesn't mean it is 'peace in our time'.\"\nSo suspicion on both sides remains strong.\nWhatever happens in the next few days, building and then maintaining trust between Iran and the key world powers, particularly the US, is still the toughest of all the challenges.", "summary": "We're fast approaching the 70th anniversary next month of the dropping of the first nuclear bomb, on Hiroshima.", "id": "33365674"}
{"document": "Christopher Hannah was driving a car which mounted the pavement and struck Sophie Brannan in Sandbank Street, Maryhill, on 14 November last year.\nHer friend Chelsea Sommerville, and Chelsea's uncle, Joseph Lloyd, were also badly injured.\nAt the High Court in Glasgow, 33-year-old Hannah, who is said to be a heroin addict, admitted a charge of culpable homicide. Sentence was deferred.\nFollowing his guilty plea, the investigating officer Det Insp Colin Hailstones said: \"This was an appallingly tragic case.\n\"Many people in the community in Maryhill were deeply affected by this incident, particularly as it resulted in the death of young Sophie Brannan, whose life was sadly taken away from her at the age of 11 and at the hands of someone under the influence of drugs.\n\"Police officers worked tirelessly to piece together the events of that fateful night and I must thank the many members of the local community and those injured who helped provide information about the incident.\"\nHe added: \"The strength shown from the community towards Sophie's family and the other people who were injured is unquestionable and much support continues to be given to them.\"\nThe court heard that Hannah was driving a hired Vauxhall Astra in the area and lost control.\nHe then fully mounted the pavement before hitting the gable end of a nearby building.\nThe car continued to career forward eventually ploughing into Sophie and the two people with her from behind.\nProsecutor Allan Nicol said: \"This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground.\"\nAnother driver witnessed the crash and turned back to help Sophie.\nMore witnesses saw Hannah speed onto nearby Maryhill Road with his badly-dented car being \"driven erratically\".\nHe then crashed into a taxi whose driver decided to follow Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away.\nMr Nicol added: \"At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off.\n\"Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed that he was under the influence of some substance.\"\nMedics found Sophie lying on the pavement. She was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones.\nThe schoolgirl remained in intensive care overnight but was pronounced dead on the morning of 15 November.\nThe court heard that Chelsea suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy.\nShe continues to wear a cast several months after the tragedy.\nMr Nicol added: \"She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts.\n\"She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.\"\nChelsea's uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later.\nHowever, he eventually required surgery and it is likely he will have \"long-term restriction\" of movement in his right shoulder.\nPolice discovered the Astra had been hired in Hannah's name on 14 October.\nThe court also heard that shortly after the incident, police searched the home of Hannah's partner, where he had been staying.\nMr Nicol said tin foil wraps with signs of drug use were discovered.\nThe prosecutor told the court: \"On the day in question, she suspected he had been taking heroin as she was aware he is heroin-dependent.\"\nHis partner revealed Hannah had come home earlier that night \"in shock\".\nHannah had claimed he had hit someone, but did not know who.\nThe killer said he was going to a house in the city's south side, but would return.\nPolice were at the house when Hannah then called his girlfriend. She handed the phone to an officer and Hannah said: \"I'm sorry - I didn't mean to do it.\n\"It was a total accident. I lost control of the car and I panicked. I'm going to hand myself in tonight.\"\nThe court heard that in the early hours of 17 November, Hannah turned up at a house in the city's Mount Florida area, but those inside decided to call police.\nOfficers turned up and arrested Hannah, who initially tried to escape. He was later searched and eight grams of heroin were discovered inside his boxer shorts.\nThe court heard how the occupants of the Mount Florida property later told police Hannah had called them on the night of the killing.\nHannah said at the time: \"There's been an accident - watch the news. The police have fitted me up.\n\"I tried to get away and I have hit something. I don't know what.\"\nMr Nicol told the court: \"He went on to say he had driven like a madman and that the something he had hit could have been a wheelie bin...but he didn't hang about to find out.\"\nHannah asked to stay for a while as the police were after him \"because he had killed a wee lassie\".\nAccident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for what happened.\nIt was stated he took \"a conscious decision\" to drive while \"impaired\".\nThey added that the reason for him not stopping was because he knew he had taken drugs and was \"aware of the ramifications\".\nAs well as culpable homicide, Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin.\nIt emerged he already had 14 previous convictions for crimes including having an offensive weapon and road traffic charges.\nHe was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash.\nHannah's advocate Thomas Ross said: \"He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.\"\nLord Bannatyne remanded Hannah in custody and deferred sentencing until May.", "summary": "A man has admitted killing an 11-year-old girl in a hit-and-run in Glasgow.", "id": "32131672"}
{"document": "Michael McConville told the BBC he took Mr Adams' remarks \"as a threat\".\nAsked about Mr McConville's allegation, Mr Adams said: \"I didn't say that.\"\nHe was released without charge on Sunday after being questioned for four days about the 1972 killing.\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in president claimed there was a \"sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign\" against him.\nIt is believed police had wanted to charge Mr Adams with IRA membership.\nIt is likely that police would have considered such a charge before he was released on Sunday night, but did not have sufficient evidence for a reasonable prospect of prosecution.\nJean McConville, a 37-year-old widow and mother-of-10, was abducted from her Belfast home, shot and secretly buried. Her body was found on a beach in County Louth in 2003.\nShe was kidnapped from her home in Divis Flats in west Belfast in front of her children after being wrongly accused of being an informer for the British Army.\nHer son Michael said his family would fight \"to the bitter end\" for justice.\nHe said he had met Mr Adams around the time that the then Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan was drawing up a report that would go on to dismiss claims Mrs McConville was an informer.\nMr McConville said: \"Gerry Adams says to me, 'Michael, you are getting a letter of support from the republican people'.\n\"He says 'if you release the names I hope you are ready for the backlash' - I took it as a threat.\"\nMr Adams denied making such a comment.\n\"If Michael McConville wants to give names, he should do so - that's entirely his right,\" he said.\nMr Adams, the former MP for West Belfast and current representative for County Louth in the Irish parliament, presented himself for interview by prior arrangement with detectives on Wednesday night.\nHe was then arrested under the terrorism act for questioning about the IRA murder of Mrs McConville.\nBBC News understands there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr Adams with any offence.\nThe Sinn Fein president was questioned for four days in connection with the murder of Jean McConville and membership of the IRA.\nHe has strongly denied all those allegations.\nA file will be sent to the public prosecution service in Northern Ireland later this week but it is thought that unless significant new evidence comes to light, he will not face any charge.\nSpeaking at a news conference in Belfast following his release, Mr Adams said he had contacted Northern Ireland police two months ago about the McConville case.\nHe questioned the timing of his arrest in the middle of an election campaign and claimed they could have used discretion rather than \"pernicious, coercive legislation\" to deal with the matter.\nHe again said he was innocent of any involvement in Mrs McConville's murder.\nHe said Sinn F\u00e9in remained fully committed to the political process in Northern Ireland. \"The IRA is gone, it's finished,\" he said.\n\"I want to make it clear that I support the PSNI.\"\nNorthern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford said he \"saw no reason\" why Mr Adams' release without charge would damage confidence in the police.\n\"With the way that Northern Ireland politics operates, there is never a good time to do anything - if it had been before Christmas it would have been the Haass talks; as soon as the election campaign is over, people would be talking about a difficult marching season,\" said the Alliance Party leader.\n\"You could always produce an excuse for the police not to do their duty at any time.\"\nThe decision to release Mr Adams means that prosecution lawyers will decide if charges will be brought.\nThe file sent by the police to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) will detail the evidence gathered.\nIt will be up to PPS lawyers to decide if there is enough evidence to bring any charges and what those charges would be.\nThe test for prosecution is met if there is sufficient evidence that can be admitted in court to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction. Lawyers must also decide if the prosecution is required in the public interest.\nIt could take some time for police to prepare the file for the PPS, with prosecutors then taking a further period to assess whatever evidence is presented.\nMeanwhile,  one of Mrs McConville's daughters, Helen McKendry, has said she is hopeful that the family will raise the money to take a civil case against the Sinn Fein president for the murder of her mother.\nLast month, Ivor Bell, 77, a leader in the Provisional IRA in the 1970s, was charged with aiding and abetting the murder, and there have also been a number of other arrests recently.\nThe case against Mr Bell is based on an interview he allegedly gave to researchers at Boston College in the US.\nThe Boston College tapes are a series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalist and republican paramilitaries, designed to be an oral history of the Troubles.\nOne of the academics involved at the outset of the project said it had been \"a car crash\".\nLord Bew of Queen's University, Belfast, said: \"I think that one of the sad things is that, first of all most importantly, not one whit of improvement has occurred for those who have suffered during the Troubles.\n\"Academically, there is a freeze now around all similar projects and that has to be regretted.\"", "summary": "A son of Jean McConville has said Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams warned him several years ago there would be a \"backlash\" if he released the names of those he believed killed her.", "id": "27280446"}
{"document": "A lot has changed since All Saints first charged onto the scene in 1997. Back then, Tony Blair had just won the election, Oasis were at number one with Be Here Now, and the world's biggest website was a page full of dancing hamsters.\nPop music was in the doldrums - this was the year of Barbie Girl and Gary Barlow's solo album - so Shaznay Lewis, Melanie Blatt and sisters Natalie and Nicole Appleton were a welcome breath of fresh air.\nPositioned as a credible alternative to the Spice Girls, they wrote their own material, dressed in street-smart clothes and shunned the chirpy choreography of other girl groups (their signature move was an apathetic shrug of the shoulders).\nBut it was a difficult time to be a woman in the male-dominated music industry.\nFemale pop stars were expected to dress provocatively - a revealing photoshoot for FHM was a rite of passage - and All Saints, never knowingly in possession of a smile, were frequently dismissed as \"difficult\" or \"sulky\".\nIt was unfair and it was sexist, protests Melanie.\n\"A lot of Britpop groups at the time would act very arrogantly and very stroppy, but that was never seen as a negative thing,\" she says.\n\"We weren't half as bad - but if we didn't want to smile one day, or we weren't really interested in doing an interview, we'd be labelled as stroppy cows.\"\nThe sexism spilled over into their TV appearances, and the band shudder as they recall a traumatic Top of the Pops taping.\n\"They were filming images of us to use as a backdrop,\" says Shaznay, \"and they wanted us to take our tops off.\"\nThe producers, they explain, wanted to shoot the band from the shoulders up, giving the impression they were performing in the nude.\n\"The vision was that we looked naked and we didn't want that vision,\" adds Natalie. \"But because it was such a huge show, we were told 'if you don't do it, you don't get to go on the show,'\" says Melanie.\n\"The girl that worked with us was in tears because she was trying to fight our corner,\" Natalie continues. \"We ended up having to compromise with the producers. We dropped our tops to here [indicating her armpits] so it would look like we were topless.\"\n\"We did it but we were stroppy about it,\" says Nicole. \"Again, we got labelled as being difficult.\"\nA BBC spokesman said: \"We're not able to comment on something that is alleged to have happened nearly 20 years ago, but today we seek to ensure that everyone working at the BBC does so in an environment in which they are comfortable.\"\nNineteen years later, squeezed together on a couch in West London, the band are anything but stroppy. They trip over each other's words, trading jokes and locking their band-mates out of hotel rooms as a way of surviving a long day of press interviews. Even the Top of the Pops incident is laughed off.\n\"These days it'd be like, 'you want to see me naked? OK! Sure!\" jokes Natalie. \"I'll take my trousers off this time!\"\nTheir camaraderie is something of a surprise. After two multi-platinum albums, the band imploded in 2001 over the disputed ownership of a combat jacket.\n\"Being in a group is like being in a marriage, and right now we are going through a really rough time,\" Nicole said shortly before the split. A subsequent statement confirmed the band were \"on ice\" in order to \"clear the air between themselves\".\nThe former schoolfriends didn't speak for years, but bridges were built during a brief reunion in 2006, and strengthened on a nostalgia tour with the Backstreet Boys three years ago.\n\"But we still get asked about the jacket every day,\" laughs Nicole.\nFollowing the 2013 tour, the band were keen to continue, but their management suggested they needed new material before going back on the road.\n\"Shaz was nominated to write the album,\" says Natalie, \"but there was no master plan, no-one telling us, 'this is the vision we have for you'. There was no pressure. And she pulled out an amazing record.\"\nAfter a year in the studio, All Saints' comeback was announced on New Year's Day via Twitter but the response was more one of curiosity than enthusiasm until the band unveiled their new single on Chris Evans's Radio 2 Breakfast show.\nOne Strike recalls the dreamy, blissed-out sound of their number one hit Pure Shores, with the quartet's silken harmonies provoking a rush of 90s nostalgia.\n\"It was a natural first single,\" says Shaznay. \"We didn't really even have to discuss it that much. It was the first song we recorded together again. It's just a great beginning.\"\nAlthough written by Shaznay, the lyrics were triggered by Nicole's divorce from Liam Gallagher. The couple split in 2013 after the Oasis star phoned his wife on holiday and confessed to fathering a child with another woman. One Strike refers to that phone call, and \"how your life can change in an instant\".\n\"Like everybody's seen and heard [in the press], I was away when stuff went down,\" says Nicole. \"I had to pull myself together because I'd got my family and kids around me but, after a couple of days of letting it sink in, I was on the phone with Shaz for a long time, just explaining [how] I was getting through it. You know, having to stand up to it, instead of becoming some sort of victim.\n\"The next thing I knew\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 she played [One Strike] to me and I was singing along. Then she said, 'were you listening to what the song's about?' and suddenly the penny dropped and I was like, 'oh my God. It's our phone call!'\n\"The thing is, for me, I've kind of handled everything with dignity and the support of the girls and my family. I think the song represents that very well. I don't feel sad when I hear it, I feel quite liberated. It's a very positive song. It's just great. It really captured the moment.\"\nAs Nicole tells this story, Shaznay quietly watches her with the protective gaze of a mother. At 40, she is the band's youngest member - but the others look up to her as the leader; the one they turn to for advice and, says Nicole, \"a great listener\".\n\"She writes poetry,\" says Natalie. \"Sometimes, when I start to think about the things she's written, it blows my mind.\"\nIn the 10-year gap between albums, Shaznay has continued to work as a songwriter, collaborating with the likes of Little Mix and Sugababes  - so how did she relocate the trademark All Saints sound?\n\"I actually can't explain it,\" she says. \"I think one of the fundamental ingredients for the sound is our voices together and that sort of slotted back into place.\"\nHowever, she says, everyone's voice changed in the intervening years, meaning the arrangements have to be re-written for their upcoming tour.\n\"I used to do the high harmony, now I do the low one,\" explains Melanie. \"My balls have dropped.\"\nNot for the first time, the band cackle with laughter, happily unencumbered by the media training that dictates most modern interviews.\n\"Artists tend to be more careful of what they say now, because it can move into the stratosphere so quickly,\" says Shaznay. \"But while it's understandable, I think it's a shame - because you lose the essence of who an artist is. You don't get a real feel for anybody, so everybody becomes generic.\"\nPerhaps that's the essence of All Saints' appeal - they're not caricatures, but real women who embrace their strengths and flaws.\nSo, is this reunion the start of a new chapter?\n\"When we'd finished this album we could have easily carried on because, by the time we got to the end, we'd started to explore different sounds,\" says Shaznay. \"I think if we hear more material that we're inspired by, we'll definitely write more.\"\n\"But we're in no rush,\" cautions Melanie. \"We're taking our time.\"\nSurely they won't wait another 10 years, though?\n\"It'll take me that long,\" says Nicole, \"to get off this couch.\"\nAll Saints' album Red Flag is out now on London Records.", "summary": "Reformed pop group All Saints discuss their new album, and recall the sexism they encountered in their first flush of fame.", "id": "36014166"}

{"document": "What should government do when things turn out to be rather different from what was expected? That's often a question politicians have to deal with when things go wrong. But what about when things go too well?\nThat might seem like an odd question, but when things go well for one group of people it can often be at the expense of another group. In part, at least, that is what has happened for the so-called baby boom generation - those born between the mid-1940s and mid-1960s.\nThe fact that they have much improved life expectancy, and much higher levels of income and wealth than any generation before them is a fantastic achievement. Those reaching retirement now are better off than any other age group. This is a historic first.\nThe worry is that the generations coming up behind them may end up rather less well off.\nEarnings are stagnating. Home ownership rates have collapsed for younger generations over the past 20 years. And the generous occupational pensions enjoyed by many baby boomers are simply unavailable to younger people unless they are lucky enough to work in the public sector.\nAt age 30, those born in the early 1980s have only half the wealth of those born a decade earlier at the same age.\nPart of the problem is that the older generation has been lucky at the expense of the younger generation. They have enjoyed enormous increases in the value of their homes, and a remarkable number have been able to buy second homes while younger people can't afford to buy.\nOn top of this, many older people enjoy generous occupational pensions that guarantee them a fixed income in retirement no matter how long they live.\nMost younger people are unable to access these \"defined benefit\" schemes. Instead most pay into a \"defined contribution\" saving scheme, creating a pension pot that may have to be stretched thin to see them through their retirement.\nThe generous occupational pensions enjoyed by older people are in significant part being paid for by younger people who will never benefit from them. Yes those benefiting made some contributions but, as it has turned out, they were nothing like enough to pay for the promised benefits. Someone has to make up the difference.\nIn addition, while a decade of interest rates close to zero has kept up the value of assets - owned by and large by the old - it has made it almost impossible for the young to accumulate substantial savings of their own.\nThis concentration of wealth in one lucky generation, and more specifically among the better off part of that lucky generation, will have profound consequences for generations to come.\nThe wealth won't disappear, it will be passed on to their children and grandchildren. Increasingly people's economic wellbeing, especially in retirement, will be determined more than at any time for 100 years by the wealth of their parents.\nIf you were born in the 1980s and want a comfortable retirement, to own an expensive house, to have financial security, you had better make sure you were born to wealthy parents.\nHere lies the dilemma. Where we are has created a clear inequity.\nBut 60- and 70-year-olds with valuable houses and generous pensions have them as of right. They have done the right things. They may have been lucky, but they have been made promises, they have entirely legitimate expectations that those promises will be honoured.\nTo break them is surely inconceivable?\nWell, even ignoring the consequences of not breaking them, it's worth asking what these promises actually mean. Nothing is forever in public policy.\nWe generally think it is reasonable for governments to change rates of income tax and VAT even if we have made our choices on the assumption they will stay much the same. State pension ages are rising, and nobody seriously thinks you can increase them only with 50 years' notice to ensure nobody currently working will be affected.\nGovernments can and do and must change policy from time to time in ways that disadvantage some people. Yet there seems to be a presumption that anything that affects pension rights or house values would involve unreasonable \"retrospection\".\nIn fact there is nothing different in kind in making changes that affect these things as opposed to anything else. Indeed we have been here already.\nI and millions of others who have spent some time in the public sector have seen our occupational pension rights cut entirely retrospectively as a result of a change in the basis of uprating from the Retail Price Index to the - more accurate but lower -  Consumer Price Index.\nSimilar changes to private sector occupational schemes should at least be on the table. As should small additions to taxes on such pensions in payment. As should other flexibilities for occupational pension schemes.

{"document": "The stormy weather made for treacherous racing on slippery roads but Team Sky's Froome survived the final descent into Morzine to maintain his overall lead.\nFroome's lead over Romain Bardet of four minutes five seconds will not be tested on the final stage in Paris.\nStage 20 was won by Spanish Movistar rider Jon Izaguirre.\nHe rode clear of fellow breakaway riders Jarlinson Pantano of the IAM Cycling team and 2014 Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali to win the 146km stage in four hours, six minutes and 45 seconds.\nFroome, who crashed on a rainy descent on Friday, was more cautious on Saturday's drop into Morzine and finished more than four minutes behind Izaguirre but only a few seconds adrift of his rivals in the overall standings.\n\"I still need to get the yellow jersey to Paris tomorrow but certainly the racing side is done and dusted,\" said Froome, who won the 2013 and 2015 editions of the three-week race.\n\"It's an amazing feeling of relief, just coming over the last line today. Thank you to all my team-mates, they've really been there for me every step of the way and I couldn't ask for more.\"\nFrenchman Bardet finished six seconds ahead of Froome to cement second place, while Quintana, who said he \"suffered from allergies\" during the race, will finish third.\nTradition dictates that the man in the race leader's yellow jersey is not challenged during Sunday's largely processional final stage in Paris which is expected to end in a bunch sprint.\nThe 113km route from Chantilly will start in pedestrian fashion with Froome posing for photographs with his team-mates, sipping the obligatory glass of champagne.\nThe stage finishes with nine laps around the centre of Paris and Froome still has to race on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees and make it across the finish line to be crowned champion for a third time.\nIn doing so, he will become just the eighth rider to win three Tour titles, following legendary five-time winners Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, while joining Philippe Thys, Louison Bobet and Greg LeMond who have all won three.\nFroome is also set to become the first man since Indurain, who won his five titles consecutively from 1991, to successfully defend the title.\nTour director Christian Prudhomme said it was Froome's incredible attacks on stages eight and 11 that were the stand-out moments for him.\n\"There was no surprise because Chris Froome won. But for me it was not the same as in previous years,\" he said.\n\"When he attacked in the Peyrsourde descent it was such a surprise. And he did it again when he went with Peter Sagan in Montpellier. I liked it very much. Chris Froome was very good, his opponents less good.\"\nBritain's Adam Yates will finish a terrific fourth overall and in possession of the white jersey as the best rider under the age of 25.\nThe 23-year-old from Bury was second from stages seven to 12, and only lost third place to Nairo Quintana, one of the pre-race favourites, on Friday's penultimate stage in the mountains.\nHowever, his initial nine-second deficit became 19 when he was penalised 10 seconds for receiving a push from an Orica BikeExchange team-mate. That gap was extended to 21 seconds as he finished Saturday's stage behind Quintana.\nYates' consolation was retaining the white jersey, which he won by two minutes and 16 seconds ahead of South Africa's Louis Meintjes.\nFroome knew only too well how easily a slip could have cost him dearly on the wet descents in this undulating stage, with his right knee bandaged from a fall in similar conditions on the previous day.\nHe had also suffered road rash on his back and, with the road damp and the downhill finish looking dangerous, he was mindful to stay safely around his team-mates.\nGeraint Thomas, who handed over his bike to Froome on Friday to let his team leader complete the stage, did the job of guiding the yellow jersey up and over Col de Joux Plane, the final mountain of this year's Tour.\nAll of the general classification front runners remained in the peloton with Froome, and the pace was only increased when Roman Kreuziger had leapt from 12th to second overall, causing slight concern among the podium contenders.\nIn the end, Czech Kreuziger was unable to maintain the pace and a large breakaway was whittled down to the pairing of Jarlinson Pantano and Julian Alaphilippe, who were soon joined and passed by 2014 champion Vincenzo Nibali.\nNibali, a favourite to win road race gold at the Olympics next month, was caught by Pantano and a resurgent Izaguirre, and the Basque-born rider descended impeccably to claim his first Tour de France stage win and Movistar's first of this year's Tour.\n\"I think my parents must have been scared watching at home,\" he said. \"I wanted to drop Nibali because I was worried about him in a sprint.

{"document": "It goes on. A first Olympic diving gold, a first Olympic gymnastics gold, and then a second, from the same man, a few hours later. Multiple Formula 1 world titles, Lions series won. The first woman in history to win an Olympic boxing gold, the first to retain one too.\nAnd now another bequest, from a man who has already provided so much. A British tennis player as world number one is an idea as ludicrous to recent memory as anything else in that giddy list, but with Andy Murray, we should no longer be surprised.\nTo a nation systematically unable to produce tennis champions despite finances and facilities at the elite level to embarrass others as well as itself, Murray is the gift that keeps giving.\nOnly 26 men have held that solitary ranking since the calculations went computerised 43 years ago. It is not a gimmick, or a marketing exercise, or even a reward in itself, but a defining benchmark. You cannot fluke it or get lucky with a judging panel. It is deserved. It is definitive.\n\"Being number one is the pinnacle of all the ambitions of every player,\" said Novak Djokovic, the man just deposed, when he began his own long reign three years ago. \"This is the dream.\"\nIt hasn't made every player happy. The only certain thing about being world number one is that the day will come when you will no longer be world number one.\nAndre Agassi has described how miserable it made him, how the achievement seemed to legitimise his father's cruel ambitions and obsessions rather than his own. John McEnroe, who spent a cumulative total of 170 weeks at the top of the pile, found it lonely atop the exposed summit.\n\"You're out there on your own island,\" he once said. \"And you feel like you're disengaged, not only with the rest of the world, but the rest of your competitors, some of them friends.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nClimbing the mountain is often an easier task in sport than defending your splendid isolation.\nThe England rugby union team who won the World Cup in 2003, having gone into that tournament as Grand Slam winners and on an unbeaten home run stretching back 22 games and four years, finished third in the subsequent Six Nations and fourth in the next two.\n\"In a game, thousands of decisions are being made, but it only needs a few to be the wrong ones for the team's fortunes to reverse,\" says Matt Dawson, scrum-half in that team. \"When it goes, it goes quickly.\"\nIt was the same for the England cricket team who rose to number one in the Test rankings after beating India in the summer of 2011: whitewashed in their next Test series, against Pakistan in the UAE, and then dismantled at home to South Africa the following summer, losing their captain Andrew Strauss and, for a while, their star batsman Kevin Pietersen.\nBeing world number one gets you respect. It also makes you a target. Everyone wants your scalp. Every defeat is automatically a headline.\nEven your own motivation can begin to slide, if only subconsciously, if only by minute fractions. How to focus on the next target when you can climb no further? Where can you go from the top but down?\nMurray's character may insulate him from those uncertainties for a while yet.\nFind out how to get into tennis in our special guide.\nThe 29-year-old's new position reflects both his own remarkable consistency over the past 12 months and the personal and physical problems that have shackled Djokovic, but it is also testament to a desire for self-improvement only occasionally found in sportsmen of his age.\nRanked 17th in the world a decade ago, he was gloriously log-jammed at four in those four seasons from 2008 to 2011, the unprecedented trio of Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal seeming to block any further ascent.\nHe dropped to sixth in 2014 after his back surgery and then appeared stymied at second for the past year as 12-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic went through the peak of his reign.\nThe belief and the hard work never dropped off. Different coaches, tweaked training, a renewed focus on the basics that, in this year alone, has seen his second serve refashioned and accelerated.\nIn defeat by Kei Nishikori in the US Open quarter-finals in September and Juan Martin del Potro in the Davis Cup semi-finals soon afterwards, he seemed physically spent - only to emerge revitalised in the past two months on this celebrated spree across first east Asia and now western Europe.\nAnd it is testament to self-belief too - that in an era decorated by three of the greatest players of all time, he could be crowned the best; that seven years and two months after first reaching number two, he could still take that final special step.\nPlenty of fine Grand Slam-winning players have never been world number one, Michael Chang, Goran Ivanisevic and Michael Stich among them.\nMany who have got there are arguably now in Murray's shadow: Pat Rafter, Carlos Moya, Marcelo Rios; definitely Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Thomas Muster; quite possibly Marat Safin and Andy Roddick, Ilie Nastase, Gustavo Kuerten and Lleyton Hewitt too.\nRankings in sport do not always reflect the accepted wisdom. Angelique Kerber may sit above Serena Williams in the women's tennis rankings, but with Williams having won five of their past six meetings and seven times as many career titles, the debate over who is the better player would be short.\nTriathlon's world rankings, based only on the year's World Series results, have Spain's Mario Mola as world number one, when every judge in the sport would define double Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee as the best in the world.\nFew could dispute Nick Faldo's claim to be the best golfer in the world when he topped golf's rankings. A few days after going to number one himself, Ian Woosnam would win the Masters.\nLuke Donald's ascension in 2011 was deserved - he was the first player in history to win the money title on both European and PGA tours in the same season - but because he had never finished as runner-up in a major, let alone won one, there were those who disputed the algorithm's accuracy. So too with Lee Westwood, number one in the same year, still to win a major five years on.\nThe number alone can be less important than the aura a player brings to it. After an unparalleled 12 months - that Davis Cup triumph, winning BBC Sports Personality for the second time, reaching his first French Open final, winning his second Wimbledon, taking Olympic singles gold yet again - Murray has that too.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAnd this may yet be the start of something even more beautiful, rather than the pinnacle.\nAfter five defeats in the Australian Open final, never will Murray have a better chance of winning it than this January, Federer and Nadal faded, Djokovic - his nemesis in four of those finals - jaded.\nThe French Open title could conceivably be the next unprecedented prize to be pouched. And then Wimbledon again, and why not, after all that has been before?\nIt is dreamy, fanciful stuff.

{"document": "The Republican nominee denied ever sexually assaulting women, but turned his fire on ex-President Bill Clinton in a bitter US presidential debate.\n\"There's never been anybody in the history of politics that has been so abusive to women,\" he said.\nHillary Clinton refused to address his comments about her husband.\nMr Trump's attack on the Clintons came after moderator Anderson Cooper asked him about a 2005 video released on Friday that revealed Mr Trump bragging about groping women.\nThe 70-year-old billionaire dismissed the remarks as \"just words\" and \"locker room talk\".\nWhen pressed on whether he had engaged in sexual misconduct, he denied doing so and instead focused on Mr Clinton's previous indiscretions.\nNo criminal charges have been brought against Mr Clinton in any allegations of sexual assault.\nMrs Clinton said the explosive video, which has sparked an exodus of Republicans denying support to their presidential nominee, \"represents exactly who he is\".\n\"With prior Republican nominees, I disagreed with them,\" she added, \"but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\nWhen the two took to the stage in St Louis for their second of three debates, they did not shake hands, striking a bitter tone that would continue throughout.\nMr Trump said if he won, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton and she would be in prison over her private email arrangements.\n\"Everything he just said is absolutely false but I'm not surprised,\" she responded. \"It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\"\n\"Because you'd be in jail,\" he interrupted.\nMr Trump also said his Democratic rival \"has tremendous hate in her heart\" while criticising her for referring to his supporters as \"deplorables\".\nMrs Clinton said she apologised for the comment, adding: \"My argument is not with his supporters, it's with him, about the hateful and divisive campaign he has run.\"\nThe two also sparred on the conflict in Syria, Russian aggression, Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and his plan for the \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants arriving from countries with links to terrorism.\nThe evening concluded when an audience member asked the candidates to say one positive thing about each other.\nMrs Clinton said his children were a great reflection of him while Mr Trump called his opponent \"a fighter\" who never gives up.\nAn hour before the debate began, Mr Trump appeared at a news conference with women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.\nHe joined three women who allege the former president sexually assaulted them and called the women \"very courageous\".\nThe Republican was under immense pressure after making obscene comments about women in the video.\nAt least 33 senior Republicans - including senators, members of Congress, and state governors - have withdrawn their support since the video surfaced on Friday.\nDonald Trump entered this debate threatening to unload every bit of malicious allegations and rumours on Hillary Clinton. And he did.\nAccusations of Bill Clinton's sexual impropriety? Check. Her work as a public defender representing a rapist? Yup. He even tied it up in a bow by remarking that his Democratic opponent should be in jail.\nMrs Clinton said she would take the high road, but she did get in her shots as well, saying the illicit video of Mr Trump's lewd comments showed who he really is.\nAnd then, after that nuclear exchange, the debate chugged along - with Mr Trump often gaining the upper hand. If his weakness is policy knowledge, there were few opportunities where his shortcoming were exposed.\nInstead, there was plenty of time for Mrs Clinton to offer a yet another muddled answer on her email server and essentially confirm that the Wikileaks hacked speech excerpts are accurate. Mr Trump offered word salads in answers about healthcare reform and Syria policy. If anything, from there the debate was a draw.\nWith Mrs Clinton ahead right now, a draw will probably suit her just fine.

{"document": "And it's tucked away for a very good reason.\nInside, your senses are greeted by the smell of rotting dog food, the buzz of blowflies and the purple UV light of the fly killer ready to zap escapees.\nThis is where the museum's forensic entomologists breed different species of fly in a bid to help the police solve crimes.\nMuseum scientist Amoret Whitaker is one of just three forensic entomologists in the UK who regularly works with the police to determine the time of death of a corpse.\n\"As soon as a person dies, their body starts to decompose and they give off specific odours. These different chemical signals are very very attractive to insects. And in the inital stages it's especially blowflies.\"\n\"So when someone dies, fairly soon, it could be within minutes blowflies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately. These will hatch into larvae or maggots and the developmental cycle will continue.\"\n\"You get a lot of male blowflies hanging around, sitting on plants around the body, waiting for suitable female mates.\"\nAnd it is this cycle of life and death that is critical in helping the police when they are uncertain of the timing of someone's death.\nBy understanding the \"succession\" rates or the speed of growth of flies, from an egg to the larval then adult stage she and her colleagues can determine the likely time that person died.\nBut scientists only have developmental data on perhaps half of the twelve or so species of fly that are regulary found on dead bodies.\nBy breeding them in \"captivity\" under different temperature conditions they can get more accurate information about the timing of their growth and so the process of death.\nThe accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been decomposing. If she can get to see a corpse within days of its death,  when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours.\nBut, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days.\nThis timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder.\n\"In some cases of assault, if someone has been seen leaving a pub after a fight say, then that person is found dead a few days later, if we can determine when they died to a matter of hours, we can help establish whether the person died from the assault or other causes.\"\nThe time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February.\nOne pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been \"mummified\".\nThe critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C.\nThis peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks.\nThe man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck.\nThe police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues' expertise.\n\"We can go two months with nothing but then be asked to help with six cases in a couple of weeks.\"\n\"It's rare that our evidence is used in court. It's more common that we give police a time window and they can then gather further evidence.\"\nForensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. If a cadaver has been burnt this makes estimating time of death difficult for the pathologist.\nBetween working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.\nThere she compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the \"body farm\".\nIn the summers of 2008 and 2009 she compared the decomposition of three pigs and three human cadavers.\nHer research isn't finalised but initial results are positive, confirming that pigs are a good model for how a human corpse decays.\n\"The same species of insects are attracted during the same time periods to both types of cadaver.  Large numbers of blowflies from days 1-5, fewer on days 6-7, and a large drop from day eight onwards,\" she told BBC News.\nShe also says this research will be very useful for all cases where insect evidence is used.\n\"This work will have a big impact when it's published, for forensic entomologists all over the world.  As it will show that pigs are a good model for humans, and therefore all the data gathered using pig cadavers can be applied to cases involving human cadavers.\"\nAmoret Whitaker is just one of the scientists demonstrating their research at the one night only event \"After Hours: Science Uncovered\" at the Natural History Museum on Friday 24th September between 1600 and 2200", "summary": "At the top of a long staircase in a room in a tower, far away from the throng of visitors and other scientists and laboratories is the Natural History Museum's insectory.", "id": "11375357"}
{"document": "But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them.\nIncreasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers and retailers.\nThe BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology.\nSurveys suggest that while 99% of people have heard of autism, only 16% really understand what it means. In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.\nIn order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.\nThe film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.\nMark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will \"help the public understand a little more about autism\".\nThe film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.\nThe film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.\nAlzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.\nA Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.\nVirtual meatballs\nVirtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.\nIn April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.\nGamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, \"not a typical Ikea customer\" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.\n\"In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,\" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.\n\"And what they wanted was meatball,\" she said.\nMeatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.\nWhen meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: \"I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.\"\n\"This is really talking to customers,\" said Ms Franov.\nNow the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.\nHealthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.\nSurgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.\nSome 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.\nNow the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately \"democratise medicine\".\nMeanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.\nIn one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.\nIn September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.\nThe kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.\nMost pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they \"were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me\".\nMarcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language.\nUsers can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall.\nMr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning.\n\"We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there,\" he said.\nIt is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films.\n\"It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,\" he said.\nAt VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.\n\"One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,\" he said.\nCash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.", "summary": "Think of virtual reality and you will probably conjure up images of fantastical landscapes in a game or film set.", "id": "37576755"}
{"document": "An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS \u00a32bn a year.\nMinisters said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter.\nSavings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents.\nOne senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time \"vetting eligibility\" of patients.\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to \"turn GPs into border guards\" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a \"fair contribution\".\nMr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must \"transcend\" financial concerns, but collecting an extra \u00a3500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors.\n\"We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one,\" he added.\nBy Nick TriggleHealth correspondent\nThe issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex.\nThe first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from.\nAnother exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public.\nBeyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia.\nIt means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country.\nThe research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify.\nMeanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed.\nThe rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers.\nThe latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research.\nThe government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the \"most thorough research there has ever been\" in this area.\nThe report itself notes that it is based on \"incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\", but it says the estimates are the \"best that can be made at present\", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been \"completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know\".\nThe government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue.\nIt has already announced a \u00a3200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise \u00a3200m a year.\nA cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK.\nMeanwhile, \"deliberate health tourism\" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between \u00a360m and \u00a380m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is \"uncertain\" and the \"plausible range\" of the cost is \u00a320m-\u00a3100m.\nFrequent visitors \"taking advantage\" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further \u00a350m-\u00a3200m a year, the report adds.\nThe government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the \"conservative\" \u00a3500m figure.\nTo achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks.\nFree NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so.\nAsylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment.\nThe UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care.\nThe NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just \u00a373m a year is recouped out of more than \u00a3460m at present.\nThis is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care.\nShadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment.\"\nBut he added the figures were based on a \"large number of assumptions\" and was more about \"spin than substance\".\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's \u00a3500m savings figure was \"exaggerated\", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans.\nHe said migrants paying the proposed \u00a3200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to \"get their money's worth\", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than \u00a3200.\nDr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments.\nDr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a \"new border agency\" in policing the NHS.\n\"The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments,\" she said.\nJonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been \"hugely overstated\" and was in fact a \"very small part of NHS expenditure\".", "summary": "Up to \u00a3500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.", "id": "24616801"}

Am I affected?\nPossibly, yes.\nEmployees who fall into the category loosely defined as \"mobile workers\" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected.\nSimon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category.\nAs many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC.\nAnd some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds.\nI travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office\nThe ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says.\nThere may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office.\nI have to commute two hours every day to my office\nFor those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the \"overwhelming majority\" in the UK.\nI think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours?\nThe ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account).\nThat could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up.\nIt could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum.\n\"I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have,\" Mr Tutton said.\nWe have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling.\nHere is a selection of their comments:\nThis is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester\nI am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge\nI am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon\nI currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow\nI am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford\nI'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our \"pickup\" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset\nI am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley\nI'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere.

{"document": "The system can involve withdrawal of medication, food and fluids.\nIt can offer a peaceful and dignified death but there have been problems with its implementation, the government-commissioned review is set to say.\nHealth officials said the review was expected to recommend the LCP should be phased out within six to 12 months.\nThe system was developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the city's Marie Curie hospice in the 1990s to provide a model of best practice in the care of dying patients.\nIt can mean an end to invasive tests, treatment or feeding through tubes that is deemed to cause unnecessary suffering at the end of life - but it should be discussed with the patient, family or carer where possible.\nThe pathway was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute.\nIt was intended to provide uniform, high-quality, dignified care for dying patients - whether they were in hospital, at home, in a care home or in a hospice.\nPreviously, there were concerns that care had been patchy, with some hospitals failing to meet acceptable standards, and accusations that people were subjected to invasive treatment and testing that offered no chance of preventing death, but merely prolonged their suffering.\nUnder the LCP, patients are regularly reviewed to ascertain whether medication should be stopped - and whether fluids should be withdrawn once they have ceased to be able to eat and drink.\nHowever, families have complained relatives were put on the pathway without their consent, and that death has been hastened in people who were not dying imminently.\nCritics say that it is impossible for doctors to predict when death is imminent, so the decision to put a patient on the pathway is at worst self-fulfilling.\nThere have also been suggestions that the pathway has been used to help hospitals save money. NHS Trusts do receive payouts for hitting targets related to its use - but the suggestion that the pathway has been used for cynical reasons has been vigorously denied by the Department of Health.\nThe Department of Health (DoH) in England set up an independent review amid fears the LCP was being used to hasten death, to clear beds and save money, and that patients or their families were not being consulted.\nThe review, led by crossbench peer Baroness Julia Neuberger, applies only to England. The LCP is also used in Scotland and Northern Ireland but not in Wales, which has its own framework for end-of-life care and support.\nA Scottish Government spokeswoman told the BBC it welcomed the Neuberger review.\n\"Recommendations set out in the report will be considered by the Living and Dying Well National Advisory Group, so that any learning for Scotland can be taken forward with stakeholders,\" the spokeswoman said.\nThe review for England was asked to focus on the use of the LCP model rather than re-evaluating its basic merits.\nBut the DoH said the review team, which heard evidence from patients, families and health professionals, encountered \"numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care\".\nThe review was likely to conclude the LCP needed to be replaced, it said in a statement.\n\"The independent review into end of life care system the Liverpool Care Pathway, commissioned last year by Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb and backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is likely to recommend that the LCP is phased out over the next six to 12 months,\" the DoH said.\nThe statement gave no indication of what might replace the LCP.\nBut Mr Lamb said: \"We need a new system of better end-of-life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families.\"\nHe ordered the review in November last year amid intense media scrutiny of the LCP following criticism from patients' families.\nAt the time, he said he was concerned about the \"unacceptable\" cases that had come to light.\nBritish Medical Association president elect Baroness Finlay said the LCP was originally brought in because patients were \"dying badly, in hospitals in particular\".\nThey were being \"walked past, ignored and neglected\", she said, and the LCP was an attempt to \"roll out the best of hospice care into other areas\".\n\"By and large that worked well but the problem has been that it hasn't always been used properly,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.\nShe said that if the LCP was phased out it was vital something better replaced it. \"Something which is very clear, very simple and which drives up professional behaviour,\" Baroness Finlay added.\nDr Linda Patterson, clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians - which has been reviewing the LCP every year since it was introduced in 2004 - said the system was \"very helpful\".\n\"But if the execution of it in all instances has not been right then we need to review that,\" she added.\n\"All doctors dealing with patients who may unfortunately die need to be trained in end-of-life care. We need to know what the standards are, we need to be able to apply them, our junior doctors and trainees need to be fully trained in it. And we also need time - time to be able to discuss these very difficult issues.\"\nJason Suckley, director of policy and campaigns at Sue Ryder, said the healthcare charity's research had shown the timing and quality of conversations health professionals had with terminally-ill patients amounted to a \"lottery\".\nHe said workers' communication skills needed to be improved and urged Health Education England, which provides training and support for healthcare professionals, to include end-of-life training in its workforce mandate.\n\"When it comes to dying we cannot afford to get it wrong and health professionals need to be supported to communicate with people effectively at a very traumatic and emotionally difficult time,\" he said.\nThe review's findings are due to be published in full on Monday.", "summary": "The Liverpool Care Pathway, developed to support patients as they near death, should be phased out in England, an independent review is expected to say.", "id": "23283820"}

At least another 900 migrants have died crossing the Mediterranean this year.\nItalian naval and coastguard ships, the Maltese Navy and cargo vessels, along with three helicopters, are involved in the rescue operation, 130 miles (210km) off the coast of Lampedusa and 17 miles from the Libyan coast.\nThe Italian coastguard's spokesman told the BBC the operation was still focused on search and rescue, \"but in time it will be a search [for bodies] only\".\n13,500\nMigrants rescued 10-17 April\n900\nMigrants died attempting the crossing  between 1 Jan and 15 April\n31,500 Migrants have arrived from North Africa so far this year\n218,000 Estimated to have crossed the Mediterranean in 2014\n3,500 Migrants died attempting the crossing last year\nThe migrants reportedly fell overboard when they rushed to draw the attention of the passing Portuguese merchant ship King Jacob, causing their ship to capsize.\nThe Italian coastguard says the 28 survivors and 24 bodies are now on its vessel the Gregoretti.\nAt the scene: Richard Bilton, BBC News, Lampedusa\nLampedusa is scrambling to react to the latest horror in the seas off its coastline.

{"document": "The Californian singer has provided backing vocals for Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Josh Groban, Carole King, Robbie Williams and Rod Stewart in her stellar career.\nMost famously, she was due to be a featured singer on Michael Jackson's ill-fated This Is It tour in 2009 - and can be seen performing a spine-tingling duet with the star in the posthumous film of the rehearsals.\nShe went on to appear on the US version of The Voice - where her shock elimination prompted judge Adam Levine to declare: \"I hate this country\".\nHill's efforts to launch a solo career were then documented in the Oscar-winning film 20 Feet From Stardom - which turned the spotlight on the (mainly African-American) back-up singers who have propped up rock's biggest stars.\nBut the catalyst for her solo career turned out to be Prince - who read about the star in a newspaper, and invited her to record an album at his Paisley Park Studios in Minneapolis.\nHill tells the BBC about their collaboration, her experiences as a backing singer, and the day that Michael Jackson died.\nWhat's the first song you remember hearing?\nWalk With Me by Vanessa Bell Armstrong\nWho was the first person who told you you could sing?\nMy mother was the first person to tell me I could sing.  She tells the story of how I was singing in the back car seat as a little girl, and she saw that I had talent.  We wrote our first song together when I was four.\nHow did you land a job on Michael Jackson's This Is It tour?\nI did a small gig in Los Angeles and became friends with some musicians there.  One of them knew Michael's musical director and he invited me to audition. I did a small audition at the vocal director's house and a couple weeks later I was hired.  I remember them telling me, \"Michael is on your Myspace page.  Change the picture!\"  At the time, I was also hired to work at a clothing shop, so I quit that job and joined the This Is It tour.\nHe was a master of stagecraft - what tips did he give you?\nMichael was fascinating to watch.  Working with him taught me the importance of seizing every moment on stage.  He painted pictures with every lyric and movement in his body.\nWhat do you remember of the day he died?\nI was sitting at a restaurant when my phone started blowing up.  There were rumours of his death but I didn't believe it.  It wasn't until later that day when this nightmare became a reality as I arrived at the Staples Center for rehearsal.  It was a very tragic day.   They had already begun to collapse the stage and pack up the gear.  Just the night before we were rehearsing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It was surreal.\nWhat was it like to sing at the memorial service?\nIt was an overwhelming experience. I mean, that was the same stage we rehearsed with him [on] two weeks prior. But it was a beautiful service.\nYou were eliminated from the US version of The Voice - what did that experience teach you?\nWhen I was on The Voice, I made discoveries about my vocal style.  No matter what the song was, I always managed to turn it into a soul song whether I wanted to or not.  I learned that at the heart of it, I'm a soul singer.  My roots run deep, starting from the early days of jamming with my parents on Sly and the Family Stone and Curtis Mayfield songs.\nWhat difference did 20 Feet From Stardom make to your career?\n20 Feet From Stardom was a special project that resonated with so many people.  We were honoured with an Oscar and Grammy and many wonderful opportunities have come my way because of it.   People were inspired by the stories in the film and they continue to follow my story to see what happens next.\nHow much of a struggle was it to make the leap to solo artist?\nIt's a very rough road - that 20 feet from being a backing singer to an artist is a long 20 feet! But what keeps me going is a passion for music. No matter what, it makes me happy to do it.\nWhat's the biggest difference between working as a backing vocalist and fronting your own material?\nWorking as a backing singer is being a part of a group effort to give the artist what they need.  It's a fun community to be a part of.  Being a solo artist is a totally different experience.  There is more responsibility and pressure, yet it is very rewarding.  I love sitting in the driver's seat, directing everybody to achieve the sound I'm looking for.  There's nothing more fulfilling than making the sounds you hear in your head become a reality.\nWho's the most demanding artist you've sung for?\nThe most demanding was Natalie Cole.  It was a short show, but she was very particular about how she wanted the vocals.  I have much respect for her.  She kept the singers on their toes!\nHow did you end up working with Prince?\nI did an interview and was asked who is my dream collaborator.  I said \"Prince!\"  He saw the interview and personally reached out to me.  I remember receiving the unknown call on my cell phone and freaking out while I was talking to him.  I officially met him at his album listening party in Los Angeles.  Shortly after, he invited me to Paisley Park and that was beginning of the collaboration.\nHe's got a wicked sense of humour... Has he ever caught you out with a prank?\nHe once called me and I didn't recognize his voice because he pretended to be someone else.  He can do great impersonations.\nWhat did he contribute to your album?\nHe's a fantastic producer and arranger.  He played many instruments, sang, arranged, and even wrote.  He was very involved in the process, yet it was a great collaboration between his ideas and my ideas.  Most of the songs were already written and he helped me come up with great grooves and effective edits.\nWhy did you call it Back In Time?\nI wanted people to feel like they have travelled back into a golden era of funk/soul music.  For me, personally, this record celebrates my childhood and upbringing in a musical family.  Many of the lyrics are autobiographical - describing where I came from, my old stomping grounds, and the amazing musical community that inspired me along the way.  The whole record feels like a dusty jam session in the basement of my parents' house.\nWhat song means the most to you?\nAngel In The Dark.  I think about the many times I felt like I was trapped in a dark tunnel, yet God has always managed to rescue me at the right time.  He is that Angel in the dark.\nJudith Hill's debut album Back In Time is out now on NPG Records.", "summary": "You may not have heard of Judith Hill, but you've almost certainly heard her voice.", "id": "34789836"}
{"document": "Reporters Gavin Sherriff and Darryl Smith worked for the Dundee-based Sunday Post, which closes its London office on Friday.\nFor decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers.\nEx-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a \"very, very important place\" through which most of the public received its information.\nThe first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702.\nAt its height, \"the Street of Shame\" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius.\nMr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years.\nHe is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats.\nAlthough the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides.\n\"I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here.\n\"I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.\"\nThe street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women.\nHe says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff.\n\"There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.\"\nMr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about.\n\"The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.\"\nHis memories of the street in its heyday are of \"watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers\".\n\"Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.\"\nMr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of \"certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then\".\nFollowing their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs.\nRobin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail.\n\"At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,\" he says.\n\"The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.\"\nLiz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there.\n\"Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street.\n\"But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street.\n\"When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one.\n\"Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm.\n\"The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street.\n\"At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool.\n\"I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him.\n\"He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'\"\nBut, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble.\nMedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions.\nBy 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards.\nAs a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the \"Stab in the Back\" is a Pizza Express.\nNow a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline.\n\"As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,\" says Mr Smith.\n\"It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.\"", "summary": "The last two journalists working in Fleet Street are leaving what was once seen as the centre of UK journalism.", "id": "36882573"}
{"document": "In 2007, the Icelandic economy appeared healthy. Its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 35% higher than it was in 2002, unemployment was 2.3% and government debt was a modest 27% of GDP.\nHowever, the assets of its three largest banks had grown to over nine times GDP, a size that made it impossible for the Icelandic central bank to act as an effective lender of last resort.\nThus, regardless of the quality of the banks' assets, the predictable consequence was a bank run and the subsequent collapse of the Icelandic banking system.\nFollowing the demise of its banks, Iceland imposed capital controls to prevent massive outflows and a plunge in the value of its currency.\nRecapitalisation of its banking system and other crisis-related expenses caused government debt to rise to 95% of GDP by 2011.\nHowever, a successful International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme cushioned the impact: real GDP fell by a less-than-expected 6.6% in 2009 and 4.1% in 2010, before returning to growth.\nIcelandic authorities protected the holders of domestic deposits, who enjoyed uninterrupted access to their accounts; the UK and Dutch governments stepped in to protect deposit holders in UK and Dutch branches of Icelandic banks.\nIn 2013, the European Free Trade Association (Efta) court ruled that Iceland did not breach its obligations, either by treating domestic deposits differently or by not accepting legal obligation for foreign branch deposits.\nToday, Iceland faces the difficult challenge of removing its capital controls in an orderly fashion but the IMF expects real GDP growth of 4.1% in 2015.\nIn 2008, the Cypriot economy was more like that of an emerging market nation than a modern European one, but the country was enjoying an economic boom.\nCypriot real GDP had grown by 27% between 2002 and 2008. The growth, however, had been fuelled by inflows of foreign bank deposits and foreign loans to banks.\nAs a result, the assets of commercial banks with Cypriot parents expanded to over five times' Cypriot GDP.\nUnlike the Icelandic banks, the Cypriot banks had a credible lender of last resort: their central bank was a member of the Eurosystem.\nUnfortunately, they were heavily exposed to Greece.\nCypriot banks were hit hard by the restructuring of Greek sovereign debt in 2012.\nIn March 2013, the Cypriot authorities were in a desperate situation. Either they had to make a sizable contribution to a European Stability Mechanism/IMF rescue package or the emergency loans Cypriot banks had been receiving through its central bank would be cut off.\nWithout the rescue package, saving the Cypriot banking system would be likely to require exiting from the euro area, adopting a new currency and recapitalising the banks by printing money.\nThis would cause the value of the new currency to plummet, taking with it the real value of Cypriot pensions, wages and bank accounts.\nTo avoid catastrophe, the Cypriot authorities looked to the one source of readily available funds: Cypriot bank deposits. Initially they planned to impose a levy on all deposits but ultimately insured depositors were spared.\nTo stem a run, capital controls were imposed. Banks were closed for two weeks and when they were reopened there was a limit on daily withdrawals.\nReal GDP fell by 2.4% in 2012, 5.4% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014. Unemployment rose to 16.2% in 2014 and government debt has climbed to 107% of GDP.\nCurrently, the outlook for Cyprus is guarded.\nThe country finally returned to economic growth this year and the capital controls were removed entirely in April. However, further economic reform is necessary to ensure sustainable growth.\nGreece currently faces a choice similar to the one faced by Cyprus in 2013.\nIts banking system depends for its survival on emergency lending controlled by the ECB.\nBank runs have forced the imposition of capital controls, temporary bank closures and limits on deposit withdrawals.\nThe consequences of leaving the Eurosystem are likely to be as dire for Greece as they would have been for Cyprus. Reaching an accommodation with its creditors is the preferred outcome.\nReal GDP has fallen by almost 30% in Greece since 2007, partly because of severe fiscal austerity.\nUnemployment was 26% in 2014 and there has been an exodus of skilled labour.\nAs with Cyprus, and unlike with Iceland, any lasting recovery will require significant economic and fiscal reform.\nGreece ranks 61st in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, edging out Russia and Cyprus (at 64) but behind Tunisia; Iceland is 12th.\nGovernment debt was already a massive 113% of annual GDP in 2008 and now stands at 180%.\nCapital controls were necessary in Iceland and Cyprus, and in Greece today, but they come at a cost.\nMany view them as an assault on civil liberties; others see them as a chance to profit.\nEven in Iceland, a remote island nation, evasion and avoidance appear to have been widespread.\nSome say they promote disrespect for the law and the belief that once again the wealthy, sophisticated and corrupt are benefiting at the expense of the rest of society.\nAnne Sibert is a professor of Economics at Birkbeck, University of London, a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research.

{"document": "At the time Mr Tilli was working as an estate agent, but with the Portuguese housing market in free fall, he was earning next to nothing.\nAnd with Portugal's government needing a 78bn euro ($103bn; \u00c2\u00a362bn) international bailout, in exchange for putting in place a number of austerity measures, the wider Portuguese economy was mired in its worst recession for more than 40 years.\nWith the jobs market having ground to a halt, and four children to look after, Magda and Miguel Tilli decided they had no option but to take a chance on starting their own company.\nMs Tilli, 37, recalls: \"We were at the beach, brainstorming about what we could do.\"\nTapping into Mr Tilli's knowledge of the property market, they recognised that they could turn a problem - no one was buying homes anymore - into a business opportunity.\nAnd so, they decided to launch an estate agent business specialising in renting houses in Lisbon city centre.\nWhile such a focus on rental properties may be common in other countries, the great majority of Portuguese estate agents only deal with selling homes.\nThis is because in Portugal owning your own house or apartment has always been such a matter of pride that it is the first choice of most people, even young adults.\nYet suddenly the great majority of young people couldn't hope to get a mortgage. Instead, a growing number living in Lisbon started to turn to the Tillis' new property rental business - Home Lovers.\nTo keep start-up costs down, the couple initially listed their available properties only on Facebook.\nYet to build up a decent reputation, they hired professionals to take all the photos, and only accepted properties of a high standard.\nMs Tilli says they picked the kind of places that appeal to young, urban professionals, such as trendy apartments.\nSoon they had a steady stream of customers, both people wishing to rent a property, and landlords wanting to list with them.\n\"It became a cool thing to rent a house through us,\" says Ms Tilli, who previously worked as a flight attendant for TAP, the main Portuguese airline.\nHome Lovers has now expanded to Porto and Cascais, two other Portuguese cities, and has a team of 20 workers.\nIt is now considering going to Madrid.\nMs Tilli says: \"I'm a bit scared with that, but I don't see us being able to do this in any more places here in Portugal.\"\nTo understand why entrepreneurship, or setting up a business, is now so popular in Portugal, you only need a quick reminder of how bad unemployment remains in the country, even though it came out of recession in 2013.\nThe Portuguese jobless rate rose from 7.6% in 2008 to 14.1% in June of this year.\nThe situation is even worse for young adults, with one out of every three people aged 15 to 24 years old out of work, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union.\nProfessor Paulo Soares de Pinho, who teaches at Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon, and runs his own investment fund, says that one of the biggest changes brought by Portugal's economic crisis was \"to transform many unemployed people into wannabe entrepreneurs\".\nYet he cautions that while many technology-minded young people are coming up with products, not all of them are able to turn them into a viable business.\n\"We're going through an app entrepreneurship wave. Any kid coming out of an engineering school develops an app and thinks he has a company,\" he says.\n\"But there are many tech projects with no market orientation whatsoever.\"\nCarlos Silva, co-founder of the crowd funding website Seedrs, agrees that in Portugal \"may start-ups are going ahead just because entrepreneurship is now a trend\".\nYet, he adds that there are \"more and more start-ups of excellent quality.\"\nTo help boost entrepreneurship, the Portuguese government has created an investment body called Portugal Ventures to invest 20m euros of public funds a year into start-up firms.\nStart-up incubators have also sprung up, to give new businesses an office or desk to help them get on their feet during their first months.\nMagda and Miguel Tilli, used one such incubator - Start-up Lisboa - during the launch of their firm.\nAnthony Douglas is another entrepreneur who has used Start-up Lisboa to get his business off the ground.\nThe 33-year-old is the founder of Hole19, a golfing app, which has mapped out thousands of golf courses around the world, and allows golfers to track and store statistics about their own performances.\nInitially it was a paid app, and the business struggled.\nMr Douglas, who has a Portuguese mother and American father, says: \"We've been almost dead a few times, with zero euros in the bank.\n\"In some months I stopped paying my own salary and had to ask relatives for money.\"\nYet Mr Douglas has since been able to transform the business's fortunes by giving the app away for free.\nThe aim is now to make money by enabling Hole19's users to book golf courses via the app, in exchange for paying a fee each time.\nMr Douglas says Hole19 was downloaded 220,000 times in the first 90 days after going free. And recently he raised 900,000 euros from foreign investors.\nJoao Romao, 25, is another young Portuguese entrepreneur who has managed to turn around his business fortunes.\nHis first start-up venture, based around the idea of a shareable gift list connected to online shops, quickly failed.\nUndeterred, he is now developing a business called GetSocial, which aims to help companies promote their content on social networks, and measure its impact.\nRecently he secured 630,000 euros of investment.\nMr Romao says: \"The first try was a good lesson learned.

But a majority of MPs demanded more action to help unaccompanied children.\nDavid Cameron has always insisted that nothing must be done to encourage refugees to make the dangerous journey to Europe so now ministers have found a compromise.\nIt's a political solution to avoid a defeat in the Commons but Tory MPs and several charities have called it \"tremendous\".\nThe implementation of the programme now depends on local authorities who have to make sure they have the funding, school places and social service support that many of these traumatised children will require.\nDowning Street hasn't put a figure on how many might be helped, but the expectation is that it will be thousands and Conservative MPs have promised to keep up the campaigning.\nThere does remain some concern though, that what's been announced won't help the most vulnerable, who might not have registered and who've disappeared from the system altogether.\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson, who pressed Mr Cameron on the issue, said he welcomed what he said appeared to be the \"beginning of a U-turn\".\nMr Cameron has been under pressure to accept 3,000 child refugees who have made it into Europe unaccompanied.\nBut the government says the number will depend on what councils can cope with.\nFunding will be made available from central government for those councils willing to take in unaccompanied child migrants, said a source.\nImmigration minister James Brokenshire told a meeting of Conservative MPs he was going to write to all local councils and ask them to gauge capacity - but warn them they should expect at least as many unaccompanied children as the UK took last year.\nLocal authorities will be expected to share responsibility because some had been overburdened, he told the MPs.\nThe Local Government Association said councils were ready to \"play their part\" but wanted more clarity on long-term funding and how the national dispersal mechanism will work.\nSave the Children said Mr Cameron had \"offered a lifeline to these vulnerable children,\" adding: \"This announcement echoes Britain's proud history of offering safety at times of great crisis and we want to thank the members of parliament who have led the way in championing this cause, as well as the British public who have opened their hearts to refugee children.\"\nConservative MP Heidi Allen - who had said she was prepared to vote against the government and support an amendment calling on the government to accept more unaccompanied children -  described the announcement as \"tremendous news\".\nBut a spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Cameron had not gone far enough - and they wanted to see \"greater action and more generosity\".\nLabour MP Yvette Coooper, who chairs the party's refugee taskforce, said more detail was needed about what Mr Cameron is planning.\n\"He was wrong to claim last week that child refugees alone in Europe don't need help, so I hope he will be clear about that now and set out what the government will do next,\" she said.\nIn a letter to David Cameron, Sir Erich Reich, chairman of Kindertransport-Association of Jewish Refugees, had called on the PM to do more to help \"the most vulnerable victims\" of the Syrian conflict.\nHe said it was \"incumbent on us to provide sanctuary to those in need\".\nMr Cameron rejected comparisons with the \"Kindertransport\" scheme that helped Jewish children escape from the Nazis, at Prime Minister's Questions.\n\"To say that the Kindertransport is taking today children from France or Germany or Italy, safe countries that are democracies, I think that is an insult to those countries,\" he told MPs.\nBut he added: \"We're going to go round the local authorities and see what more we can do, but let's stick to the principle we should not be taking in new arrivals to Europe.\"\nIn September 2015 the government said the UK would accept up to 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years.\nAnd last month the government said it would accept up to 3,000 more refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the Middle East and North Africa by 2020.\nIn his letter, Sir Erich, who was among thousands of Jewish children rescued from Nazi Germany, said he had learned of the rejection of the resettlement proposal \"with great sadness\".\nHe added: \"I strongly urge you and your colleagues to reconsider how we can intervene to help some of the most vulnerable victims of an internecine conflict that has claimed the lives of thousands of people and displaced millions.\n\"The echoes of the past haunt many of my fellow Kinder and I whose fate similarly rested with members of the British parliament.\n\"I feel it is incumbent on us to once again demonstrate our compassion and human-kindness to provide sanctuary to those in need.\"", "summary": "David Cameron says the UK will take in more unaccompanied Syrian refugee children from Europe, although it has not committed to a specific figure.", "id": "36200366"}

My photos on there are really me, but nothing else is.\"\nShe said she was doing it to save money so she could go away and study.\nBut that was 2013, and this is now. Has fake girlfriend tech moved on?\nWhile browsing Product Hunt, a great site that highlights new apps and ideas, I recently spotted an intriguing service called Invisible Girlfriend.\nIt promised me the chance to sign up and create my perfect girlfriend, and soon I'd start getting text messages from her so I could impress all of my friends.\n\"My cofounder had the idea for years,\" said Kyle Tabor, the site's chief executive, in an email.\n\"He mainly needed a fake girlfriend to get his parents off his back after he was divorced.\"\nIt works like this. You pick from one of six broad personality types - because there are only six types of women in the world, you understand. Rejecting \"saucy and sarcastic\" I went with \"lovingly nerdy\".\nFaced with a stock photo library of about 30 people, I picked out a picture of a pretty brunette. I should, apparently, save it to my phone to show my friends later.\nAfter a selecting a few standard interests - \"lower league English football\" wasn't available - I was then given help concocting a convincing back story.

What about you?\"\nBored already? Me too. But that's what makes this service more interesting than I'd first assumed.\nI thought this would essentially be a sex line. So if I said: \"What are you up to?\", the answer would be an attempt at sexiness, like: \"Ooh, I'm all alone ;);)\" and so forth.\nYet the service seems to strive to be somewhat unsexy, almost mundane - like real life. I half expected her to ask me to pick up some milk on the way home.\nThat authenticity is helped by the fact that the texts are written by real people, a team of \"real anonymous humans\" replying to every message.\nMy cagey attempts to inject a bit of rudeness fell flat. The raunchiest exchange being: \"What's the sexiest thing you could wear?\" met with: \"My skin lol. Or a skirt\".\n\"Can you send me a pic of yourself?\" I asked, only to get \"O->-<\" in return. That's an emoticon of a person lying down, in case you can't tell.\nI'd have pushed it further, but the thought of some \"real anonymous\" bloke texting me back made me feel strange.\nTo sum up: a ludicrous, pathetic idea, that no-one would possibly take seriously. Or so I thought.\n\"We have had thousands of users pay for the service,\" Mr Tabor told me.\n\"It's about 50/50 between the text only and the full suite.\"\nYou read that right. People pay for this (according to Mr Tabor at least).\nIf you just want text messages, it costs $15 a month. The full suite is $25, and you get voicemails and all sorts for that.\nThe service isn't just for fake girlfriends, either. The site also lets women, or gay men, sign up and have a fake boyfriend. And what Mr Tabor said next surprised me the most.\n\"Actually, over 60% of our accounts choose boyfriends.\"\nConsider me baffled. Why would anyone want or need this?\n\"Several reasons,\" Mr Tabor said.\n\"Get parents off your back, get a co-worker to stop hitting on you, make an ex jealous, or maybe just to practice flirting.\"\nHis team takes the illusion responsibility seriously.\nI wanted to use the image of my beloved Alma Doris in this article, but Mr Tabor politely asked that I didn't, on the off-chance it might blow someone else's cover story.\nAn extensive how-to guide contains tips such as how to talk about your girlfriend/boyfriend, what questions to expect from pushy friends, and common mistakes people make when lying through their teeth about an imaginary human. There's even a live chat function to ask for advice from the site's staff.\nBut in the end, I had to break up with Alma Doris.\n\"I'm moving to Yemen,\" I said. She didn't understand.\nIf this service seems sad to you, then don't laugh. Just be thankful. Many users, Mr Tabor said, used the service for companionship. Someone to text for a chat now and then.\nLike Sophia in 2013, Invisible Girlfriend and Boyfriend is satisfying a need, and a harmless one at that.\nIf people are prepared to pay for a service, and others are prepared to provide it - then fine.\nAnd for the record, the woman behind Sophia did go on to save enough to study.

How we respond will determine the impact on jobs and growth.\n\"We must provide fiscal credibility, continuing to be tough on the deficit while being realistic about achieving a surplus by the end of the decade.\"\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move, saying: \"Sadly the vote last Thursday for Brexit has only brought forward what was inevitable.\n\"The Chancellor had already dropped his other fiscal rules on welfare and debt at the Budget in March, and according to many economists he was expected to be forced to drop this one too.\"\nBBC business editor Kamal Ahmed says that the target was heading for the \"Treasury shredding machine\" following a speech from Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday.\nIn a speech launching her bid to become prime minister she said \"we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament\".\nKamal says that Mr Osborne has now followed suit.\nNevertheless, the Treasury insists that it still wants to balance the books and \"fix the finances\".\nMr Osborne first committed himself to returning the national finances to surplus by 2020 at the Conservative Party conference in 2013 and it became policy in the July budget of 2015.\nBut there have been questions ever since over whether that target could be met.\nEven before the referendum vote he only had \"a slightly better than 50/50 chance\" of making the target said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nBut the uncertainty caused by the Leave vote could hold back the economy and make creating a surplus even more difficult.\n\"Having voted for Brexit last week, the economy is clearly going to go into a downswing, that might be a full-blown recession, that might just be very very low growth,\" said Paul Johnson the director of the IFS.\nIt is sometimes easy in these incredible political times to forget that for most people \"it's the economy, stupid\" still holds true.\nFor the UK economy, one of the most important passages of Theresa May's speech yesterday was when she signalled that George Osborne's \"fiscal rule\" (to produce a budget surplus by 2020) was for the Treasury shredding machine.\n\"While it is absolutely vital that the government continues with its intention to reduce public spending and cut the budget deficit, we should no longer seek to reach a budget surplus by the end of the parliament,\" Mrs May said.\nNow the chancellor has said he agrees, arguing that the government must be \"realistic\" about its fiscal targets and that austerity policies could be eased.\nMy Treasury sources point out that the \"rule\" can be varied in \"non-normal\" times.\nAnd these are pretty \"non-normal\" times.\nThe abandonment of the fiscal target suggests the government could borrow more, presumably for investment in infrastructure and to mitigate the need for tax rises and spending cuts, if the economy does take a turn for the worse as some predict.\nMore from Kamal: Brexit and the easing of austerity\nThe Tories have been in turmoil since David Cameron announced his intention to resign following the UK's vote in favour on leaving the European Union.\nIn a shock development on Thursday, Boris Johnson, widely seen as the frontrunner to become prime minister, announced that he would not be running.\nThe BBC has learned that Justice Secretary Michael Gove is now coming under growing pressure to abandon his bid to become Tory leader.\nSources have told the BBC government ministers are trying to persuade the justice secretary to give way so the party can \"unite\" around Home Secretary Theresa May.\nMr Gove opted to stand after switching his support from Boris Johnson.\nIn a speech, Mr Gove said his decision to stand to become Conservative leader is driven by \"conviction\" about what is right for the UK not personal ambition.\nThree other candidates have put their names forward for the Conservative leadership: Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, MP Liam Fox and Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb.\nThe government borrowed \u00c2\u00a374.9bn in the 2015/2016 fiscal year and for the financial year so far - covering April and May - borrowing reached \u00c2\u00a317.9bn, \u00c2\u00a30.2bn higher than the same period a year ago.\nIt is thought that the government will now raise borrowing, so it can avoid further cuts in spending or raising taxes. It could also borrow to invest in big building projects.\n\"The problem of course is, you can't borrow forever,\"said Paul Johnson from the IFS.\n\"So we'll have a few more years of more borrowing, but my guess is this is not the end of austerity, actually this means austerity will just go on for longer because we'll probably have the spending cuts and tax rises right through the 2020s to pay for this.\"", "summary": "Chancellor George Osborne has abandoned his target to restore government finances to a surplus by 2020.", "id": "36684452"}
{"document": "In his regular BBC Sport column, football pundit Robbie Savage looks at why Liverpool look a long way off repeating last season's title challenge, how they should line up against Chelsea and the physical and mental battle Steven Gerrard faces to secure a long-term future with the Reds.\nIt is only six months since Steven Gerrard's slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool's title bid.\nBack then, at the end of April, the title was in the Reds' grasp. This weekend, I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge.\nThey are miles away from the level required for that, and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four.\nIf they manage it, then securing back-to-back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.\nBut not all their fans see it that way. I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on  606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick.\nPart of Liverpool's problem is that they overachieved massively last season, which has raised expectations unrealistically. That is not Rodgers' fault.\nWhere he can be questioned is in the transfer market, especially up front.\nBetween them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool's 101 Premier League goals last  season.\nWith Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury, Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line-up.\nBut he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system.\nLooking at Rodgers' options up front for Saturday, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men, and the bottom line is that they are not good enough.\nIt is not just that they do not look like scoring. There is a big difference in their work-rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team.\nThat means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season, or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes.\nDoing that in 2013-14 Liverpool scored 59 first-half goals, 13 more than any other team, and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight.\nIn their first 10 games of this campaign, they have only managed a total of four goals before half-time, in three different matches. Instead of being on the front foot, they are having to chase games.\nThey look pedestrian and that is not just the centre-forward's fault.\nWhen I have watched them, no matter what formation they play, they do not seem to have any runners going past their striker from midfield.\nAgain, last season that used to happen all the time, but I was at St James' Park last weekend to  co-commentate on their defeat by Newcastle, and the only player to run beyond Balotelli in the first half was Gerrard, who did it once.\nAnother problem is set-pieces. Liverpool were lethal from them last year, scoring with more than any other top-flight team.\nMore than a third of their goals in 2013-14 came from corners or free-kicks, at a rate of almost one a game. That has dropped off dramatically.\nSadly for Rodgers, seeing the goals drying up is not his only problem.\nLiverpool's defence was seen as their weakest link last season and, despite trying several different combinations, he did not get it right.\nFrom Mamadou Sakho for \u00a318m in 2013 to Dejan Lovren for \u00a320m this summer, Rodgers has thrown a lot of money at the problem but is still trying to find an answer.\nThey still look all over the place at the back.\nStatistically, they are no worse defensively than last season - but they are also no better.\nLiverpool play and complete as many passes as before, and also keep as much possession. But with them no longer being able to outscore the opposition, it is no surprise their results have been affected.\nWhat Liverpool lack at the back is a leader, and their goalkeeper does not give them much help there.\nSimon Mignolet is clearly an excellent shot-stopper but I don't see him coming off his line enough, or commanding his box.\nRodgers tried three at the back against the Magpies, but I cannot see him doing the same against Chelsea.\nHe was criticised for resting players against Real Madrid on Tuesday but I agreed with him for doing it.\nLiverpool can still qualify for the knockout stages in Europe if they win their last two games in Group B and their weakened team actually did better against Real in Spain than the full-strength side he picked at home.\nNow he has to decide who to play against Chelsea, but whoever he picks, Liverpool will need to show a huge improvement on their recent displays.\nMy team to face Liverpool: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Toure, Moreno, Can, Gerrard, Sterling, Coutinho, Lallana, Borini.\nFor me, Lovren is the big signing who makes way, with Kolo Toure keeping his place after doing well at the Bernabeu.\nIt is a big call to drop Lovren when Rodgers has spent so much money on him, but he has just not been good enough.\nIt is hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet\nHe was poor against Newcastle and has been poor all season.\nAlthough he has got the height that Liverpool will need to defend set-pieces against Chelsea, I saw him get bossed around by Bobby Zamora when Liverpool played QPR at Loftus Road. You have to think that Diego Costa would make mincemeat of him if he is up front for Chelsea.\nTo compete, Liverpool will need a solid four in the middle, with their full-backs looking to join the attack.\nWhether it be Glen Johnson on the right or Alberto Moreno on the left, when one goes forward, then the other should sit back.\nThat way, Liverpool will always have five defensive players to guard against Chelsea's counter-attacks.\nGoing forward, they need their full-backs to contribute in the same way they did last season when they overlapped down the flanks or broke forward with speed.\nThe trio of Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling as attacking midfielders provide pace, trickery and creativity and, leading the line, Borini gives more energy than Lambert or Balotelli.\nHe will have to work hard down the channels to keep Chelsea's defence busy.\nEven if all of that works, however, it is still hard to see Liverpool winning on Saturday because Chelsea are on a different planet to every other Premier League team at the moment.\nJose Mourinho's side have not been at their best in the last couple of games but they have not lost any of them either.\nThe only way you would describe their form as disappointing would be in comparison to the way they started the season, when they were electric.\nThe Blues do not seem to have a weakness and, just like in April, I see them leaving Anfield with three points.\nThere is no title on the line this time, but it will still hurt the home fans.\nWhatever happens on Saturday will not make up for what was probably the worst moment of Gerrard's career. He may never make up for it, but there is no way he is finished.\nHe was Liverpool's best player against Newcastle and, despite it still being uncertain whether he will get a new Reds contract in the summer, I definitely see him as being part of their longer-term future.\nPlaying in that defensive midfield role, he can remain competitive in the Premier League. I cannot see him being allowed to leave Anfield but, if he does, he will end up at another top club.\nThe older you get, the harder you have to work, though, and extending his career will be a mental battle as well as a physical one.\nAt 34, he does not have to prove he can ping a ball 60 yards, deliver a great free-kick or make a crunching tackle.\nWhat he has to show is that he can still get about the park well enough to do all of those things effectively.\nBecause, whether he likes it or not, every time he has a bad game he will hear the accusation that \"his legs have gone\".\nOf course he is still fit and can still run. He is probably one of the fittest players at Liverpool. At 36, when I was at Derby, I was still in the top two or three players whenever we did the bleep test.\nWhat happened against Chelsea last time probably destroyed Gerrard on the inside\nBut it is the recovery that will test him. When you are flying, you can close someone down, then charge into the next challenge or situation.\nAs you get older, it is harder to get to the next man in time to make a difference. That is what people mean when they say your legs have gone.\nThere is nothing worse as a high-energy midfield player to know that, two or three years ago, you could have made that next challenge - and now you can't.\nI knew it when it happened to me. I would try not to think it but you cannot escape it and it was horrendous. I began to doubt myself and whether anybody would want me to play for them.\nWhat does not help is what other people say. Managers and players told me I was finished but I had to keep believing in myself.\nI knew I was not the player I was, but I still felt I had something to offer.\nFor me, Gerrard undoubtedly does too.

{"document": "The report, carried out by charity Relate and based on a survey of 20,980 people in relationships from 2013-15, suggested 2.87 million people were in \"distressed\" relationships.\nDr David Marjoribanks, from Relate, said constant bickering could have a \"far-reaching\" impact on children.\nOn average they did worse in school and could even fall into crime, he said.\n\"It is not just the actual breakdown of the relationship itself, it's specifically the conflict that surrounds that,\" Dr Marjoribanks said.\n\"It means that when relationships end, it is not deemed to inevitably harm children, far from it.\n\"It is the conflict in intact relationships that can be just as damaging, as when relationships end,\" he added.\n\"Children who grow up with parents who have highly-conflicted relationships are much more likely to have mental and physical health problems, to not do as well at school and end up in antisocial behaviour and criminality even.\"\nIt may have seemed a small thing but Sophie*, 28, knew her marriage was over when she came home from work to have lunch with her out-of-work husband and he expected her to make it.\nThings had not been right for some time. There had been arguments about money, jobs and housework shortly after the wedding, often in front of their young son. But soon communication shut down almost entirely as both felt the arguments were always the same and nothing would ever change.\nDays would go by with neither of them talking to each other.\nThey tried counselling but it came at a cost and they found themselves forced to choose between a counselling session or buying food for the week.\nIn January last year, after three years of marriage, Sophie told her husband, 41, it was over.\n\"As soon as we separated I immediately felt lighter. I did not have to do all this stuff for someone who did not do anything,\" she said.\nBoth are now in new relationships, and Sophie, who lives in West Yorkshire, says she now tries to make time to talk about things as soon as they come up and to be more open about money.\n*Not her real name\nResearchers looked at data from the Understanding Society survey of 20,980 people which asked people how often they argued, how frequently they considered divorce and regretted the relationship, and the extent of their unhappiness.\nThey said their findings suggested 2.87 million people, which equates to 18% of married or cohabiting couples, were living in \"distressed\" relationships, where the strains were deemed to be \"clinically significant\" by counsellors.\nThe number of \"distressed\" relationships reached a high in 2011 and 2012 but have not yet returned to pre-recession levels, the data showed.\n\"There is a pattern of relationship strain increasing during recession years - where economic strain increases, for example low income, unemployment, a build-up of debt, the strain on the relationship increases,\" Dr Marjoribanks said.\nThe research also found:\nDr Marjoribanks said many couples suffered in silence for years and only sought help when it was too late to salvage their relationship.\nJan Artingstall from Therapy Cheshire, who is listed in the Counselling Directory, believes people today spend so much time communicating via text and social media that they have forgotten how to talk.\n\"People have lost the art of talking about how they feel. It's like we have gone back to being children who don't have the language to communicate feelings,\" she said.\nA common problem among couples was mistrust built around text messages sent between work colleagues and partners spying on each other's online communications, she added.\nHer advice is for couples to sit down for 10 minutes to talk about their day and take joint responsibility for the state of the relationship, rather than pointing fingers.\nShe also said children who saw their parents fall out and make up were learning a useful lesson but daily and embedded conflict was damaging.\n\"Children are very perceptive to atmosphere. It doesn't have to be a shouting match - they can pick up on stonewalling and tense body language.\n\"Children won't say 'Are you unhappy Mummy or Daddy?' They just accept and absorb the atmosphere and feel unhappy inside.\"\nThere were 114,720 divorces in England and Wales in 2013, down 3% on 2012, the most recent figures available from the Office of National Statistics show. The number of divorces was highest among men and women aged between 40 and 44.\nIn Scotland, 9,030 divorces were granted in 2014-15, 6% fewer than in the previous 12 months, Scottish government figures show. Northern Ireland saw a slight rise in divorce rates from 2,403 in 2013 to 2,455 in 2014, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.\nChris Sherwood, chief executive at Relate, said the report's findings were \"hugely concerning\", adding that \"families can't go on like this\".\nThe charity was launching its first national appeal, Breaking Point, calling for donations to help make its services available to everyone, not just those who could afford them, he added.", "summary": "Almost one in five (18%) couples in the UK argue regularly or consider separating, a study suggests.", "id": "36373299"}
{"document": "Former Manchester United player and coach Phil Neville explains what Louis van Gaal has learned from his first season in the Premier League and why his team are not far away from being title contenders again.\nThis season, they have dropped points in 10 out of their 16 away games against teams below them in the table. They got rolled over at Everton and Leicester, and drew with Burnley, Sunderland and West Brom.\nIn the past, the aim at United was always to do the double over everybody outside the top six.\nWe approached all of those games - home or away - with the aim of winning them and doing that was one of our strengths down the years.\nThat meant, when we came up against our rivals in the top five, our record against the rest meant that those big games were not must-win and the pressure was off us a bit.\nThis season, it has largely been the opposite. United have produced their best football against the other teams in the top five and have struggled against the sides that have camped in their own half and made things difficult for them.\nGoing forward, United need a player who can make the difference in those games, when the opposition are packing their defence.\nChelsea have that with Eden Hazard. Last season, Luis Suarez did it for Liverpool. Those players can win you the title because, when games are tight, they make the difference.\nBut at the moment United do not have anyone who is providing those bits of individual brilliance in the final third.\nA lot of people are saying Gareth Bale would be the answer to that particular problem but I think United already have the right player on their books - if he performs to his capabilities.\nAngel Di Maria arrived for a British record fee last summer but, considering his \u00a359.7m price-tag and his reputation, he has not delivered since his first three or four games.\nEven so, he is still the United player who excites me the most.\nEverything about the way he plays from his pace, his skill, and his ability running or passing forwards tells me he has what it takes to shine at Old Trafford. He has just not done it yet.\nNext season could be the time when he realises what it takes.\nHe now knows there are no easy games in the Premier League, and that he has to toughen himself up.\nDi Maria will also understand that United are a huge club. He is on a big stage and there is a bit of pressure on him.\nWe know he can do much better, and so will he.\nI would love to see him play to his potential because he could be the attacking star this United team needs to make the next step.\nVan Gaal's first season as United manager is also almost over and he will have found out a lot about English football over the last few months.\nEarlier in the campaign, he tried playing three at the back and I don't think that system worked for United.\nVan Gaal probably tried it because he was trying to accommodate Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata in the same team, but he has realised that he can't do that in the Premier League.\nWhen he arrived at Old Trafford, I think he might have under-estimated that anyone can beat anyone in this country.\nMaybe in some of the countries where he has managed in the past, teams in the bottom half of the table do not even give you a contest. Here, they do.\nAt times Van Gaal has probably been surprised by the intensity of every game that United have played, but he will have learned from it too.\nNext season, he will come back and be thinking 'I know what I need to do'.\nVan Gaal has achieved his aim for his first year at United by securing a top-four finish and a return to the Champions League. Because of that, it has been a good season for him.\nNow his next target is to win the title, and I don't think United are far away from being champions again.\nThe important thing is that they are going in the right direction. To go from seventh, where they finished last season, to first was always going to be impossible.\nPeople might say that is defeatist and not the way United should think but you cannot make that leap, even by spending \u00a3150m like United did last summer.\nYou have to do it gradually. Going from seventh to fourth then first is achievable, although it clearly will not be easy.\nCan they do it? If David De Gea leaves, then that would be a big blow. Without him in goal, I don't think they would have finished in the top four this time.\nI am worried he will go because he has not signed a new contract and the noises coming out of the club about his future are not good, particularly if Real Madrid do come calling.\nAlong with Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young and Juan Mata, De Gea's individual form has been one of the high points of the season.\nBut it was United's sensational team performance in their win over Liverpool in March that was the most encouraging thing for the future.\nFor me, it was their performance of the season and the one that gives me massive hope for what they can achieve next season.\nIn fact, that period in March and April where they also beat Tottenham and Manchester City gave us a glimpse of what this team can do.\nThat is the level that they have to play at consistently to challenge for the title.\nThey could not do it this time but, just as with Van Gaal, a lot of United players will be better for what has happened to them in the last few months. I am expecting further improvement from them too.\nPhil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "summary": "I think Manchester United can be Chelsea's closest challengers for the title next season, but Louis Van Gaal has got to get things right away from home against the so-called lesser teams.", "id": "32775998"}
{"document": "I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blas\u00e9 attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation.\nHe is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web.\nTo some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet.\nTo others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted.\nDingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues.\nBut we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas.\nThe timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (\u00a30.7bn) a year in revenue.\nDingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web.\n\"I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,\" he tells me, \"where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article.\n\"The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story.\"\nThe Tor Project's website has a section called \"Abuse FAQ\".\nIt is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes.\nWhen talking about this, Dingledine invokes the \"guns don't kill people\" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do.\n\"I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things.\n\"It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists.\"\nI guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online.\n\"I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,\" Dingledine insists.\n\"Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there.\"\nIn layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track.\nThere have been rumours that law enforcement has \"cracked\" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid.\n\"As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor].\n\"Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect.\"\nAny major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing.\n\"Which is frustrating,\" Dingledine interjects, \"Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy.\"\nTor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading \"Tor Stinks\u2026 but it could be worse\", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: \"We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time.\"\nGiven this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties.\nHe is confident that funding will continue.\n\"A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet.\"\nThe reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in.\nIn 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month.\n\"About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,\" Dingledine says.\n\"Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing\u2026. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase.\"\nThe ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online.\nBut given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing.\n\"I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,\" he says.\n___________\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\nYou can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370", "summary": "When Roger Dingledine talks about the dark web, he waves his hands in the air - as if not quite convinced of its existence.", "id": "40810771"}

By the age of 15, he was competing internationally as a British karate junior. Then, by 2002, he was the brakeman in a British World Cup bobsleigh team.\nWhen injury ended his bobsleigh career, he turned to rowing and was soon competing internationally as part of an 'adaptive' mixed coxed four crew.\nAlong with the sports that Smith competed for Great Britain, he also won a shinty junior Scottish title, competed in Austria, France and New Zealand in skiing and claimed a East of Scotland 400m athletics title.\n\"I wasn't massively slow, I was running about 49 seconds in my first year in the sport so I just thought it was just another dream gone.\n\"It was then that it hit me - I had the bug and really wanted to be an Olympian. I was never going to let it go and it turned into a bit of an obsession.\"\nBy chance, he one day turned on the television and saw bobsleighing. There were no bends, he fancied himself running in a straight line on ice and went for it.\nHe was brakeman for the British four-man bob that fell one hundredth of a second short of making it to the Winter Olympics in Turin.\nThen a mystery neck injury, a constant pain thought to have been brought on by overtraining, ultimately forced him to give up bobsledding.\nHe calls the realisation that his foot classified him for the Paralympics a \"sliding door\" moment in his life and chose then to take up rowing.\nAnd it is not just because that particular sporting adventure started with World Championship victory in 2009 and finished on the top step of the podium at Eton Dorney.\nRather, it was team physiotherapist Patrick Dunleavy's discovery in 2010 that there was something not quite right when manipulating his spine.\nDoctors investigated, discovering that that mystery neck injury was in fact a tumour the size of a tennis ball embedded in his upper spine, behind his throat.\n\"All I thought about was that I needed to be in London. I never made a team with it [the tumour] in me. But with it taken out there was nothing to stop me from getting to London,\" Smith said.\n\"There are complications with surgery sometimes and I suffered a blood clot inside the spinal chord. Once they sent me home to Ascot I woke up one morning and was paralysed from the neck down. I was rushed back into hospital for another surgery.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAfter his second operation he had to learn to walk again, not that Smith would let something like that stop him from achieving his Paralympic dreams.\n\"I just remember lying there thinking 'I'm still going to be in London and going to win gold'. I didn't mean it in an arrogant way. I just wanted it so, so much and would do anything to get to the start line.\"\nScar tissue from that life-threatening spinal surgery - with surgeons opting to go through the front of his neck and around his windpipe and vocal chords to access the spine - eventually led to his retirement from rowing and now poses new problems.\nHe even has plans to cycle around the world, but after being invited to trial with the GB cycling team he admits his appetite for competition is far from satisfied.\n\"My one love is pulling on that GB top and competing - it's that one moment when you are competing and your heart rate is over 170 and you are giving it everything,\" he said.\n\"I don't really know what the future holds, I have to go in for more scans to see what is happening with the scar tissue because if that continues to grows to the same size as the tumour it will cause the same problems.\n\"Life is all about hurdles - it is how we get over them which defines who we are.\"\nInterview by BBC Radio Berkshire's Adrian Williams.", "summary": "Life-threatening surgery, broken bones and a lifetime of obstacles have not stopped Paralympic champion David Smith scrapping, splashing and sliding his way to the top.", "id": "25019896"}

{"document": "In a town north of Paris, the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine had been holed up at a printing warehouse. They have now been killed and their hostage freed.\nIn Paris itself, a gunman holding hostages in a Jewish supermarket has been killed, but a number of hostages also died.\nHere is what we know about the attackers so far.\nTwo brothers accused of carrying out the massacre at the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday were killed two days later when police stormed the building where they had been holding a hostage.\nTwo men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had been barricaded in a printing factory in Dammartin-en-Goele, 35km (22 miles) from Paris.\nCherif, 32, was jailed in 2008 and had long been known to police for militant Islamist activities, prior to the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices, which killed 12 people.\nCherif, who also went by the name Abu Issen, had been part of the \"Buttes-Chaumont network\" that helped send would-be jihadists to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-UK invasion in 2003.\nHe grew up in an orphanage in the western city of Rennes, where he trained as a fitness coach.  In the early 2000s, he joined his elder brother at his home near Paris and worked as a pizza delivery man, media say.\nPolice detained him in 2005 just as he was about to board a plane for Syria - at the time the gateway for jihadists hoping to fight US troops in Iraq.\nLe Monde reports that, following Cherif's imprisonment between January 2005 and October 2006, he first came into contact with the man who would become his mentor - Djamel Beghal.\nBeghal was sentenced to 10 years in prison in France in 2001 for his part in a plot to bomb the US embassy in Paris.\nIn 2008, Cherif Kouachi was jailed for three years for his role in sending militants to Iraq, but 18 months of the sentence was suspended.\nEric Bade, a neighbour living in Genneviliers, north-west of Paris, described Cherif as \"well-behaved, friendly, polite, clean-looking and above all, which is very important, he was willing to help old and disabled people\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Bade said Cherif \"wasn't aggressive - he wasn't a crazy zealot, he was a calm person\".\n'Iraq connections'\nThe brothers had allegedly attended a mosque near the Buttes-Chaumont, an area of northern Paris, where they came under the influence of a radical imam called Farid Benyettou. He reportedly encouraged them to study Islam at his home and at a Muslim centre in their area.\nA key figure in the Buttes-Chaumont network was Boubaker al-Hakim, a militant linked to al-Qaeda resistance against US forces in Iraq, a French expert on Islamists says.\nA French court jailed Hakim for seven years in 2008, at the same time as Cherif, along with Farid Benyettou, who got six years. That action broke up the jihadist network they had created.\nIn a blog article (in French) Middle East expert Jean-Pierre Filiu says Hakim had recruited militants to fight in Falluja, an Iraqi city that became an al-Qaeda stronghold in 2004.\nHakim is also wanted in Tunisia over the murder of two Tunisian left-wing opposition politicians in 2013 - Chokri Belaid and Mohamed Brahmi. Hakim claimed the murder in the name of the Islamic State militant group, Mr Filiu says.\nIn 2010 Cherif Kouachi was named in connection with a plot to spring another Islamist, Smain Ait Ali Belkacem, from jail - a plot hatched by Beghal, according to French anti-terror police.\nBelkacem used to be in the outlawed Algerian Islamic Armed Group (GIA) and was jailed for life in 2002 for a Paris metro station bombing in 1995 which injured 30 people.\nSaid Kouachi, 34, was also named in the Belkacem plot, but the brothers were not prosecuted because of a lack of evidence.\nSaid's ID card was found in the brothers' getaway car which they abandoned after the Charlie Hebdo shooting, police sources say.\nThe gunman who is thought to have killed four people and held a number of others hostage at a Jewish supermarket in eastern Paris has been identified as 32-year-old Amedy Coulibaly.\nPolice also believe he killed a policewoman in the Montrouge area of the French capital on Thursday.\nCoulibaly is believed to have had a long history of criminal activity -  including drugs offences  - and links to at least one of the Kouachi brothers.\nBorn in Juvisy-sur-Orge on the outskirts of Paris, he is said to have been one of 10 children. He worked for Coca Cola.\nHe met then-President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace in 2009, as part of an employment initiative.\nIn an interview with Le Parisien at the time, he said it would be \"impressive\" to meet Mr Sarkozy, and that he was not sure what he would say.\nHe had added that his temporary job at the local Coca Cola plant would be over soon, and that he hoped Mr Sarkozy could help him get a job.\nReports say Coulibaly - along with Cherif Kouachi - was a committed follower of Djamel Beghal.\nIn 2013 he was jailed for five years for his involvement in the 2010 plot to free Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from prison, following the militant Islamist's conviction over the 1995 Paris metro station bombing.\nHe met Cherif Kouachi while in prison.\nCoulibaly was released last year.\nHe is said to have told police from the supermarket on Friday: \"You know who I am.\"\nAn acquaintance told AP news agency that he was \"totally shocked\" when he found out about Coulibaly's role in the attacks.\n\"He never went to prayers or talked about Islam,\" the fellow drug dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\nCoulibaly's mother and sister have issued a statement condemning his attacks.\nThey offered \"sincere condolences\" to the families of the victims, and said: \"We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion.\"\nMeanwhile, police are still trying to trace Hayat Boumeddiene, a 26-year-old woman who was Coulibaly's partner.\nShe is thought to have married Coulibaly in a religious ceremony in 2009 - however, these ceremonies are not recognised in France unless an official civil ceremony is also carried out.\nShe is now believed to be in Syria. She arrived in Turkey in early January, before crossing into Syria on 8 January, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on 12 January.\nPolice had previously identified her as a suspect in Thursday's shooting of a policewoman.\nFrancois Molins, the chief prosecutor in France, said Boumeddiene had exchanged more than 500 phone calls with the wife of Cherif Kouachi in 2014.\nFrench newspaper Le Monde published a series of photographs said to show Coulibaly with Boumeddiene in 2010. In one, she is pictured pointing a crossbow at the camera while wearing a full-face veil, which is banned in France.\nPolice questioned Boumeddiene about Coulibaly in 2010. During the interview, she was reportedly asked about her reaction to attacks by al-Qaeda, and responded: \"I don't have any opinion\", before blaming the US for civilian deaths.\nWho is Hayat Boumeddiene?", "summary": "Police in France have brought to an end two hostage stand-offs, killing three attackers.", "id": "30722038"}
